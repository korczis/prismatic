# Legacy Analysis

This document provides analysis of legacy systems and migration strategies for the Prismatic AI Agent Framework.

## Overview

The legacy analysis covers:
- **Existing System Assessment**: Evaluation of current implementations and their limitations
- **Migration Strategies**: Approaches for transitioning from legacy systems to the new framework
- **Compatibility Requirements**: Ensuring backward compatibility where necessary
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential issues during migration
- **Timeline Planning**: Phased approach to system modernization

## Legacy System Components

### Current Architecture
- Monolithic design patterns that need decomposition
- Tightly coupled components requiring modularization
- Legacy data formats requiring transformation
- Outdated API interfaces needing modernization

### Migration Priorities
1. **Critical Systems**: Core functionality that must be preserved
2. **Data Migration**: Ensuring data integrity during transition
3. **API Compatibility**: Maintaining service continuity
4. **User Experience**: Minimizing disruption to end users

## Recommendations

- Implement gradual migration strategy
- Maintain parallel systems during transition
- Comprehensive testing at each migration phase
- Documentation of all changes and rollback procedures
