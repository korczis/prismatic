# Architecture Documentation

The Prismatic framework is built on solid architectural foundations that ensure reliability, scalability, and maintainability. This section covers the core design patterns, system architecture, and implementation strategies that make Prismatic a bulletproof platform for AI agent development.

## üéØ Architecture Principles

### Fault Tolerance First
- **Supervision Trees**: Hierarchical error handling and recovery
- **Let It Crash**: Embrace failure and recover gracefully  
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Bulkheads**: Isolate system components

### Distributed by Design
- **Location Transparency**: Agents work across nodes seamlessly
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add capacity by adding nodes
- **Network Partitions**: Handle split-brain scenarios
- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept temporary inconsistency for availability

### Protocol-Based Architecture
- **Behavior Protocols**: Define agent capabilities through protocols
- **Polymorphism**: Multiple implementations of the same protocol
- **Composition**: Build complex behaviors from simple protocols
- **Testing**: Mock implementations for comprehensive testing

## üìã Architecture Documents

### Core Architecture
- **[Bulletproof Foundations](bulletproof-foundations.md)** - Core patterns and principles
- **[Enhanced Architecture Specification](enhanced-architecture-specification.md)** - Complete system design

### Design Patterns
- **SOLID Principles** - Applied to Elixir and agent systems
- **Event Sourcing** - Immutable event streams for state management
- **CQRS** - Command Query Responsibility Segregation
- **Saga Pattern** - Distributed transaction management

### System Components
- **Agent Runtime** - Core agent execution environment
- **Message Routing** - Inter-agent communication infrastructure
- **State Management** - Distributed state synchronization
- **Monitoring & Observability** - System health and performance

## üîß Implementation Strategies

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core agent infrastructure
2. **Phase 2**: Multi-agent coordination
3. **Phase 3**: Distributed deployment
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features and optimization

### Technology Stack
- **Elixir/OTP**: Core runtime and supervision
- **Phoenix**: Web interface and real-time communication
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data storage
- **TimescaleDB**: Time-series data and analytics
- **MeiliSearch**: Full-text search capabilities

### Quality Assurance
- **Property-Based Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Load Testing**: Performance under stress
- **Chaos Engineering**: Failure scenario testing
- **Security Audits**: Regular security assessments

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Read the Foundations** - Start with [Bulletproof Foundations](bulletproof-foundations.md)
2. **Study the Specification** - Review the [Enhanced Architecture](enhanced-architecture-specification.md)
3. **Explore Patterns** - Understand the design patterns used
4. **Build and Test** - Implement following the architectural guidelines
