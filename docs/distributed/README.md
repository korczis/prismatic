# Distributed Operations Documentation

The distributed system provides multi-node deployment, clustering, consensus mechanisms, and fault tolerance for scalable agent societies.

## 📋 Overview

The distributed system enables:
- **Multi-Node Clustering**: Seamless agent distribution across multiple nodes
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Reliable distributed decision-making and coordination
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent distribution of computational workload
- **Fault Tolerance**: Comprehensive failure recovery and system resilience
- **Network Partitions**: Graceful handling of split-brain scenarios
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Dynamic addition and removal of cluster nodes

## 🏗️ Architecture

The distributed system leverages Elixir/OTP's built-in distribution capabilities while adding Prismatic-specific coordination and management features.
