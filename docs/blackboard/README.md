# Blackboard System Documentation

The blackboard system provides distributed communication and shared knowledge space for multi-agent coordination and information sharing.

## üìã Overview

The blackboard system enables:
- **Distributed Communication**: Shared information space accessible by all agents
- **Pattern Matching**: Subscribe to specific information patterns and updates
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Collaborative problem-solving through shared data structures
- **Event Coordination**: Synchronization of agent activities and decision-making
- **Persistent Storage**: Durable storage of shared knowledge and communication history
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for information access and modification

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The blackboard follows the classic blackboard architecture pattern, adapted for modern distributed systems with Elixir/OTP supervision and fault tolerance.

## üéØ Implementation Status

- [ ] **Phase 2**: Basic Blackboard System
  - [ ] Core blackboard infrastructure
  - [ ] Pattern subscription system
  - [ ] Basic persistence layer

- [ ] **Phase 4**: Advanced Features
  - [ ] Distributed blackboard across nodes
  - [ ] Advanced pattern matching
  - [ ] Access control and security
