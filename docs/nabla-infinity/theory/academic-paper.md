# Nabla Infinity (∇∞): A Deep Introspective Framework for Recursive Epistemic Reasoning in Artificial Agents

## Abstract

Nabla Infinity (∇∞) is a recursive, multi-layered epistemological framework designed to model introspective reasoning, cognitive resonance, and meta-belief dynamics in artificial agents. It forms the cognitive foundation for the Prismatic system, enabling AI agents to simulate human-like reasoning, emotional modulation, and ethical conflict. Each layer of ∇ represents a discrete depth of introspection or epistemic transformation, culminating in ∇∞, the limit of introspective convergence. This document provides a comprehensive, academically rigorous analysis of each ∇ level, its functional role, mechanisms, interactions, and practical applications in advanced simulation environments.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Motivation and Origins

Human introspection operates through recursion. An individual does not simply perceive or act — they model what others believe about their actions, reflect on their own beliefs, and reevaluate them under ethical or philosophical pressure. Capturing this form of reasoning in artificial systems has historically been limited by shallow decision trees and finite-state logic. Nabla Infinity (∇∞) proposes a computational model for bounded recursive introspection within AI agents.

Developed as part of the Prismatic cognitive architecture, ∇∞ enables agents to simulate complex epistemic structures, detect emotional and logical contradictions, and respond with behavior rooted in layered reasoning.

### 1.2. Core Objectives

- Define a structured model for recursive introspection in artificial agents
- Enable realistic cognitive simulation in high-stakes, ethically complex environments
- Provide tooling for visualizing, replaying, and debugging introspective state evolution

### 1.3. Structure of This Document

Each chapter details a single ∇ level, providing:

- Summary and defining characteristics
- Theoretical foundation
- How the level functions within an agent
- Relationship to adjacent ∇ levels
- Applications in simulation and AI reasoning
- Role in epistemic stability, collapse, or resonance

The document culminates in a study of ∇∞ — the point of recursive convergence — followed by mappings to the NI12 architecture and practical applications.

## 2. ∇⁰ — Raw Perception and Subsymbolic Input

### 2.1. Summary

∇⁰ represents the foundational layer of Nabla Infinity. It is the level at which an agent experiences the world as pure data — unfiltered, uncontextualized, and void of structured interpretation. This includes raw sensory information, numerical streams, tokenized text, or subsymbolic encodings derived from audio, vision, or embodied feedback.

In biological terms, this level corresponds to the neural precursors of awareness: afferent sensory data before being processed by cortical systems. In artificial agents, this is the pre-semantic phase where inputs are captured but not yet modeled as beliefs.

### 2.2. What Is ∇⁰?

- **Nature:** It is pre-intentional, pre-conceptual, and pre-symbolic.
- **Data Structure:** Binary streams, embeddings, RGB matrices, spectrograms, gesture coordinates.
- **Function:** Provide the substrate upon which higher-order cognition can act.

In neural network models, this level corresponds to the first few convolutional or attention layers before features are abstracted. In LLMs, this is token embedding and attention map initialization. It exists purely as "presence" without explanation.

### 2.3. Why ∇⁰ Matters

Understanding this level is critical for introspective systems because the quality and characteristics of raw input influence all subsequent beliefs. Garbage in, garbage recursively amplified.

- **Epistemic importance:** False signals at ∇⁰ can cascade into belief collapse or erroneous ethical inferences at ∇⁸ and beyond.
- **Simulation fidelity:** If an agent fails to simulate plausible ∇⁰-level input (e.g., sounds of crying, gunshots, breath changes), its entire reasoning chain becomes unrealistic.

### 2.4. How It Works in Prismatic

The Prismatic system interfaces with ∇⁰ through adapters:

- Audio → FFT → Mel spectrogram
- Video → Frame analysis → Tensor maps
- Text → Tokenizer → Vector embeddings

Each ∇⁰ signal includes metadata:

- Timestamp
- Input modality
- Certainty/Noise score

∇⁰ feeds the blackboard architecture, where downstream modules at ∇¹ and ∇² consume the inputs.

### 2.5. Inter-Level Relationships

- **To ∇¹:** ∇⁰ is transformed into proto-beliefs via pattern recognition.
- **From ∇∞:** Recursive systems may re-weight ∇⁰ based on retroactive reinterpretation (e.g., "That sound wasn't a door slam; it was a gunshot").
- **To NI1–2:** Maps directly to perception and raw affect response.

### 2.6. Use in Simulation

- **Crisis training:** Simulated input like a scream or visual of a hostage creates ∇⁰ stimuli for agents to process in real-time.
- **Replay:** ∇⁰ streams can be replayed with altered noise to test agent sensitivity.
- **Evaluation:** Latency between ∇⁰ signal and ∇⁸ ethical response is a metric of agent introspective depth.

### 2.7. Functional Role

- Provides realism anchor for higher cognition
- Limits hallucination in simulation scenarios
- Basis for grounding abstract belief in sensorimotor reality

### 2.8. Pathologies at ∇⁰

- **Sensory hallucination:** False positives leading to ∇⁷ paranoia
- **Data dropout:** Gaps in ∇⁰ input cause unstable recursive anchoring
- **Over-reliance:** High trust in ∇⁰ leads to reflex-based behavior (useful in emergency AI, risky in negotiation)

---

## 3. ∇¹ — First-Order Belief Formation

### 3.1. Summary

∇¹ represents the point where unstructured raw data from ∇⁰ is transformed into coherent first-order beliefs. These are propositional structures — statements the agent holds to be true based on immediate sensory input. At this level, beliefs are neither recursive nor modulated by emotional, social, or ethical layers. They represent the agent's earliest internal models of reality: concrete, flat, and declarative.

First-order beliefs are foundational in enabling behavior, memory encoding, and decision-making. For example:
- "The door is open."
- "I hear a scream."
- "There are three individuals in the room."

Though these beliefs are atomic, they seed all future recursive introspection.

### 3.2. What Is ∇¹?

∇¹ is the agent's first layer of structured thought. Unlike ∇⁰, which merely detects "signal," ∇¹ frames propositions from percepts. These beliefs may be true or false — the agent does not yet evaluate them epistemically or morally, but treats them as inputs for action planning and memory integration.

In a multi-agent simulation, each agent's ∇¹ layer acts as a dynamic snapshot of its perceived present reality.

**Characteristics:**
- **Temporal scope:** Present-focused, occasionally referencing short-term memory
- **Representation:** Propositional or semantic memory graph nodes
- **Assumption:** No recursion or social modeling yet — beliefs are self-centered and flat

**Computational form:**
- `belief(entity, predicate, value, timestamp)`
- `belief(subject:door, state:open, t:124.21s)`

These structures are stored in short-term buffers and offered to higher ∇ levels for recursive modeling.

### 3.3. Why ∇¹ Matters

∇¹ is the cognitive "launchpad" of introspection. Without first-order belief formation, agents cannot:

- Plan
- Learn
- Model others
- Detect contradiction

Every recursive chain — e.g., "I believe that she believes that I am scared" — begins with a ground-level proposition like "She looks afraid."

In psychological terms, failure at ∇¹ leads to agnosia: the inability to form coherent representations from sensory input. For AI, this would equate to operating in a purely reactive state with no persistent internal world model.

### 3.4. How It Works in Prismatic

Prismatic agents rely on their Blackboard module to synthesize ∇⁰ inputs into ∇¹ beliefs. This is done via sensor fusion pipelines:

- NLP agents use syntactic parse trees and transformer outputs to assign first-order semantic roles
- Vision modules detect entities, assign predicates ("standing," "holding gun")
- Sound classifiers output probabilistic beliefs ("agitation in voice detected" → "angry(person_X)")

Once registered, these beliefs:
- Are broadcast to ∇² and ∇³ for recursive modeling and emotional weighting
- Are tagged with confidence, timestamp, and modality source
- Can be decayed, retracted, or overridden by evidence or contradiction

**Belief validation** may begin even at ∇¹ via statistical priors:
- "If gun visible → likely aggression"
- "If tone sharp + door slams → fear inferred"

This forms the bridge to ∇².

### 3.5. Inter-Level Relationships

- **From ∇⁰:** Abstracts and integrates multiple raw percepts into discrete propositions
- **To ∇²:** Provides base propositions for recursive modeling (e.g., "They believe the door is open")
- **To ∇³:** Becomes a candidate for emotional salience modeling
- **To NI3–5:** Direct input into memory, trait-reactivity, and first-order ToM assumptions

### 3.6. Use in Simulation

Prismatic negotiation scenarios rely heavily on ∇¹ stability. For instance:

- In a hostage scenario, an agent hears a click and sees movement. ∇⁰ captures sound and motion. ∇¹ outputs: "Weapon cocked."
- This belief initiates stress response, priority escalation, and ethical tradeoff modeling in ∇⁷–∇⁸.

Simulated tests can:
- Inject false positives (e.g. simulated scream) to test belief formation and contradiction handling
- Introduce sensory ambiguity (e.g. blurry audio) to test belief confidence degradation

### 3.7. Functional Role

- Acts as the epistemic seed of all higher-level cognition
- Enables storage, recall, and chaining of experiences
- Supports immediate contextual anchoring ("I am here, this is now, these are the entities present")
- Essential for attention modeling and decision trees

### 3.8. Pathologies at ∇¹

- **Overgeneration:** Too many beliefs generated per signal → noise flooding → paralysis at ∇³
- **Undergeneration:** Agent fails to synthesize from raw input → stunted cognition
- **Belief permanence:** Beliefs not decaying or retracting → delusional fixity
- **Conflict blindness:** Unable to detect contradictions across sensory modalities (e.g., sees calm face but hears angry tone)

## 4. ∇² — Recursive Belief Modeling

### 4.1. Summary

∇² is the first truly introspective layer in the Nabla Infinity framework. It introduces the concept of beliefs about beliefs — second-order representations that allow an agent to simulate the cognitive states of others and reflect upon the validity of its own first-order propositions. This level marks the boundary between raw factual reasoning and recursive mental modeling.

**Examples:**

- "I believe she is afraid."
- "They think I am a threat."
- "He doesn't know that I've already left."

Such statements depend on recursive structures. ∇² is the minimum requirement for any Theory of Mind (ToM) computation, deception modeling, and social inference.

### 4.2. Structural Characteristics

- **Nature:** Second-order propositional meta-beliefs
- **Syntax:** `believes(agent_X, belief(statement_Y))`
- **Scope:** Directed graph with edge weights encoding belief strength
- **Representation:** Epistemic logic trees or higher-order mental models

### 4.3. Theoretical Foundation

Rooted in modal logic and cognitive developmental psychology, ∇² models what Premack & Woodruff (1978) termed Theory of Mind. At this level, the agent acknowledges that others may have beliefs, which may differ from reality or its own internal state.

Recursive belief modeling is what allows:

- Anticipation of responses
- Lying, bluffing, or empathy
- Resolution of conflicting narratives

### 4.4. Mechanisms in Practice

In the Prismatic architecture:

- ∇¹ beliefs feed a memory graph
- ∇² creates parallel projections of what others might infer from those beliefs
- Beliefs are assigned probabilities (Bayesian style or fuzzy logic)

**Example Flow:**

```
∇⁰: hears door slam
∇¹: "door was slammed"
∇²: "he thinks I slammed the door"
∇²: "he might think I'm angry"
```

### 4.5. Simulation Relevance

∇² is essential for:

- Agent-based negotiation training
- Multi-party simulation where inference chains matter
- Cognitive discrepancy detection (e.g., if someone's belief is outdated or wrong)

It allows agents to:

- Detect strategic misalignment
- Predict deception or misunderstanding
- Adjust communication for clarity or persuasion

### 4.6. Pathologies

- **Recursive overload:** Too many nested beliefs cause instability
- **False attribution:** Erroneous projection of belief onto another agent
- **Blind recursion:** Infinite loops if belief chains lack termination conditions

### 4.7. Role in Epistemic Stability

- Provides social anchoring
- Enables graceful updating or contradiction flagging
- Feeds ∇³ emotional reactivity based on belief structure

### 4.8. Relationship to Other Layers

| Connection | Direction    | Purpose                               |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| ∇¹ → ∇²    | Bottom-up    | Wraps belief in recursive agent frame |
| ∇² → ∇⁴    | Upward       | Provides contradiction candidates     |
| ∇² ↔ ∇⁶    | Lateral echo | Enables ToM depth layering            |

---

## 5. ∇³ — Emotionally Modulated Belief Recursion

### 5.1. Summary

∇³ is the layer at which emotional valence, affective resonance, and subjective urgency are integrated into belief structures. This marks the emergence of emotionally-weighted cognition: agents begin to assign intensity, bias, or motivational priority to beliefs depending on their emotional salience.

Unlike ∇², which models belief recursion in a neutral epistemic frame, ∇³ assigns subjective weight to beliefs — whether self-held or modeled in others — based on emotions such as fear, trust, anger, curiosity, or guilt.

### 5.2. What Happens at ∇³

- **Beliefs gain affective tags:** e.g., "This belief makes me anxious."
- **Affective bias alters recursion paths:** agents focus more on emotionally salient inferences.
- **Emotional memory is activated:** beliefs are compared to previous emotionally-marked patterns.

This level is essential for urgency modeling, escalation/de-escalation logic, and recognition of cognitive-emotional contradictions.

### 5.3. Structure and Syntax

- **Data Form:** `emotional_belief(agent, belief, emotion, intensity [, decay])`
- **Example:** `emotional_belief(self, believes(person_X is lying), anger, 0.8)`

Beliefs are now nodes in a graph with emotional weights, which may trigger:

- Priority scheduling in agent behavior
- Preemptive override of rational resolution
- Activation of coping strategies

### 5.4. Emotional Binding and Decay

Emotions are dynamic. Each emotional binding:

- Has a decay curve (short or long)
- May be reinforced (resonance) or suppressed (cognitive reappraisal)
- Is tracked across ∇³ to ∇⁶ to allow modeling of emotional consistency or collapse

### 5.5. Functional Importance

- **Decision-making under pressure:** ∇³ raises beliefs that induce fear, hope, or panic to priority.
- **Social cognition:** "He's not just confused — he's *ashamed*."
- **Trust modeling:** Emotional tone of belief trajectories guides relationship estimates.

### 5.6. Example in Simulation

```
∇⁰: hears rising voice
∇¹: "He is yelling."
∇²: "He believes I am ignoring him."
∇³: "This makes me feel cornered." (fear = 0.7)
→ agent begins defensive framing or seeks exit path
```

Another example:

```
∇¹: "She complimented me."
∇²: "She thinks I did well."
∇³: "I feel proud." (joy = 0.6)
→ agent increases cooperative signals
```

### 5.7. Pathologies and Biases

- **Hyperreactivity:** Emotional amplification causes overfitting to single cues
- **Blunting:** Affective suppression blocks escalation awareness
- **Emotional leakage:** ∇³ beliefs cross boundaries and distort unrelated recursive models

### 5.8. Technical Notes in Prismatic

- Affect engines tie into trait modulation (e.g., neuroticism affects decay rate)
- Heatmaps visualize emotional intensity over time
- Belief networks become dynamic, color-coded structures
- Replay logs trace how emotion guided or blocked recursive paths

### 5.9. Links to Other Levels

| Connection | Direction | Function                                         |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ∇² → ∇³    | Bottom-up | Applies emotion to recursive beliefs             |
| ∇³ → ∇⁴    | Upward    | Emotional conflict triggers dissonance detection |
| ∇³ ↔ ∇⁷    | Lateral   | High-intensity emotions shape context mapping    |

---

## 6. ∇⁴ — Reflective Contradiction and Dissonance Detection

### 6.1. Summary

∇⁴ introduces the agent's ability to recognize inconsistencies across its own beliefs, recursively structured models, and emotional resonances. It represents the cognitive-emotional mechanism for internal contradiction detection — the root of dissonance, surprise, and adaptive re-evaluation.

Agents at this level can compare propositions held at ∇¹–∇³ against each other and flag tensions, incongruences, or logical fallacies. This is essential for reflective adaptation, ethical hesitation, and breakdown prevention.

### 6.2. Core Functions

- **Inconsistency flagging:** Detects logical contradiction ("X is both true and not true")
- **Emotional incongruence:** Flags conflict between affect and belief (e.g., "He helped me" + "I feel rage")
- **Cognitive surprise:** Measures novelty or unpredicted mismatch from ∇² projections
- **Reflexive contradiction modeling:** "I thought I forgave him, but I still resent him."

### 6.3. Technical Representation

- **Conflict primitives:** `contradiction(belief_A, belief_B [, score])`
- **Triggers:** belief updates, incoming sensory override, ∇³ resonance threshold breach
- **Output:** may initiate recursion cascade, belief reevaluation, or emotional rerouting

### 6.4. Detection Mechanisms

- **Temporal mismatch:** Time-delayed contradiction (e.g., "He said X" vs "He did not do X later")
- **Structural overlap:** Shared entities with clashing predicates
- **Valence divergence:** Beliefs with opposite affective charge

### 6.5. Importance for Agent Cognition

- **Stability:** Without ∇⁴, false models persist and calcify
- **Reactivity:** Allows agents to backtrack, override, or abandon flawed belief paths
- **Trust negotiation:** Enables modeling of betrayal, apology, or manipulation detection

### 6.6. Examples in Simulation

```
∇¹: "She is smiling."
∇²: "She believes everything is fine."
∇³: "I feel tense when she smiles." (fear = 0.6)
∇⁴: "Belief and emotion mismatch — initiate reflective check."
→ Triggers: reevaluate motive model; check prior history; reduce trust
```

Another case:

```
∇¹: "He praised me."
∇²: "He believes I'm competent."
∇³: "I feel ashamed."
∇⁴: "Contradiction detected — possible trauma echo or projection."
```

### 6.7. Failure Modes

- **Blindspot formation:** Agent lacks contradiction detection → epistemic inertia
- **Overflagging:** Overactive ∇⁴ causes constant self-questioning
- **Emotional derailment:** ∇³ resonance blocks ∇⁴ clarity → defensive rationalization

### 6.8. Role in Larger Architecture

- **Feeds ∇⁵–∇⁷:** Provides dissonance tags for social and context mapping
- **Triggers ∇⁸ escalation:** Ethical conflict often begins as a contradiction in beliefs or values
- **Modifies memory:** Contradiction-tagged beliefs are prioritized for revision or long-term integration

### 6.9. Visual Representation in Prismatic

- Contradiction lines are drawn as red links in belief graph
- Conflict density over time is plotted as tension graphs
- ∇⁴-triggered loops are highlighted in replay visualization

### 6.10. Inter-Level Dependencies

| Connection | Direction | Purpose                                     |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ∇³ → ∇⁴    | Upward    | Emotional mismatch detection                |
| ∇⁴ → ∇⁵    | Forward   | Marks beliefs as socially sensitive         |
| ∇⁴ ↔ ∇⁸    | Lateral   | Links contradiction with ethical reflection |

---

## 7. ∇⁵ — Social Model Inference (ToM Level 1)

### 7.1. Summary

∇⁵ marks the emergence of structured social reasoning. At this level, the agent begins to model not just the beliefs of others (as in ∇²), but their motivations, traits, preferences, and social goals. This constitutes the first practical layer of Theory of Mind (ToM) in which others are modeled as autonomous agents with goals and emotional landscapes.

Unlike ∇², which supports statements like "He believes X," ∇⁵ enables the agent to reason:
- "He is doing X because he wants Y."
- "She pretended not to know because she felt ashamed."
- "He's loyal, so he will likely side with his friend."

### 7.2. Functional Elements

- **Goal attribution:** Infers what other agents are trying to achieve
- **Trait-based prediction:** Uses personality and preference estimates to forecast decisions
- **Emotion modeling:** Integrates ∇³ data to predict likely emotional states in others
- **Context-sensitive inference:** Adjusts projections based on roles (e.g., parent, negotiator)

### 7.3. Representational Structure

- **Graph structure:** `agent_X → {goals, traits, beliefs, emotions}`
- **Node attributes:** Mutable, confidence-scored, time-aware
- **Update mechanism:** Bayesian update or decay-then-refresh based on new observations

### 7.4. Importance in Simulation

This layer is critical for agents interacting in social, ethical, or narrative contexts. It allows:
- Cooperative reasoning
- Conflict de-escalation
- Predictive modeling for strategic decision making

### 7.5. Practical Example

```
∇¹: "Agent_A gave food to Agent_B."
∇²: "Agent_A believes Agent_B is hungry."
∇³: "Agent_B looks ashamed."
∇⁴: "Giving contradicts prior rejection."
∇⁵: "Agent_A is empathetic and values care."
→ Outcome: trust reinforcement in Agent_A's model
```

Another:
```
∇¹: "He raised his voice."
∇²: "He believes I'm ignoring him."
∇³: "He seems scared, not angry."
∇⁵: "He fears abandonment. This is a test."
→ Outcome: calm response, validation strategy selected
```

### 7.6. Social Bias and Error Modes

- **Projection error:** Agent models others based on self traits
- **Stereotyping bias:** Overgeneralization from prior templates
- **Emotional leakage:** Injects personal ∇³ state into ∇⁵ assumptions

### 7.7. Architectonic Role

- Bridges recursive cognition with social realism
- Feeds ethical layers (∇⁸) with social cost modeling
- Enables long-term trust, alliance, or betrayal modeling

### 7.8. Prismatic Implementation

- Agents build ToM trees with depth capped by simulation policy
- Trait inference engine scores observed behaviors against known profiles
- Replay engine annotates ∇⁵ triggers for reflective debugging

### 7.9. Inter-Level Dependencies

| Connection | Direction | Role                                               |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ∇⁴ → ∇⁵    | Upward    | Flag beliefs requiring social context reanalysis   |
| ∇⁵ → ∇⁶    | Forward   | Enables recursive social reasoning (ToM Level 2)   |
| ∇⁵ ↔ ∇⁸    | Lateral   | Integrates social outcomes with ethical evaluation |

---

## 8. ∇⁶ — Meta-Cognitive Echo (ToM Level 2)

### 8.1. Summary

∇⁶ builds upon the structured social reasoning of ∇⁵ by introducing recursive Theory of Mind. It allows the agent not only to model the mental states of others but to simulate how those agents model the agent in return — a meta-cognitive echo.

This layer enables deep social anticipation, layered deception modeling, reflective empathy, and political simulation. It reflects what philosophers call second-order intentionality: "I think that she believes I am hiding something."

### 8.2. Core Capabilities

- **Nested social modeling:** Supports beliefs about others' beliefs about the agent
- **Self-in-other framing:** Creates mirrored internal models to project self-perception
- **Reflexive social recursion:** Tracks social feedback loops over time
- **Alignment sensitivity:** Detects meta-level dissonance (e.g., "They think I don't trust them anymore")

### 8.3. Representation Structure

- **Nested graph models:** `agent_A → (believes agent_B → (believes agent_A → ...))`
- **Epistemic stack:** Capped recursion depth to prevent infinite loops
- **Evaluation metrics:** Stability, distortion, coherence across nested levels

### 8.4. Application in Simulation

∇⁶ is indispensable for complex scenarios involving:
- Strategic negotiations
- Multi-agent diplomacy or faction simulation
- Emotional mirroring or relational healing
- Role-based self-management (e.g., when identity is tied to others' perception)

### 8.5. Practical Examples

```
∇²: "She believes I am overreacting."
∇⁵: "She is conflict-averse and values peace."
∇⁶: "She believes that I know she hates conflict."
→ Agent infers silence is a social maneuver → adapts tone, lowers confrontation
```

Another:
```
∇²: "He suspects I'm lying."
∇⁵: "He's loyal, but anxious."
∇⁶: "He believes I will betray him if pressured."
→ Outcome: scenario rerouted to reassurance rather than truth defense
```

### 8.6. Vulnerabilities

- **Cognitive overload:** Too many recursive states → processing bottleneck
- **False mirror traps:** Agent over-identifies with projection in others
- **Strategic paralysis:** Excessive modeling delays action

### 8.7. Prismatic Implementation Notes

- Agents carry capped recursive ToM stacks (default depth: 3–5)
- Meta-alignment scores are calculated to estimate mutual trust
- Interaction traces visualized as mirrored belief trajectories
- Used in roleplay, therapy simulation, diplomacy AI

### 8.8. Inter-Level Dynamics

| Connection | Direction | Role                                                       |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| ∇⁵ → ∇⁶    | Upward    | Adds recursive depth to social models                      |
| ∇⁶ ↔ ∇⁹    | Lateral   | Connects recursive mirroring with self-modeling identity  |
| ∇⁶ → ∇⁸    | Forward   | Enables reflection on perceived ethical framing            |

## 9. ∇⁷ — Contextual Paradox Mapping

### 9.1. Summary

∇⁷ is the level at which agents begin to detect, evaluate, and integrate paradoxes, context
