## 1.1. Motivation and Origins

Human introspection operates through recursion. An individual does not simply perceive or act — they model what others believe about their actions, reflect on their own beliefs, and reevaluate them under ethical or philosophical pressure. Capturing this form of reasoning in artificial systems has historically been limited by shallow decision trees and finite-state logic. Nabla Infinity (∇∞) proposes a computational model for bounded recursive introspection within AI agents.

Developed as part of the Prismatic cognitive architecture, ∇∞ enables agents to simulate complex epistemic structures, detect emotional and logical contradictions, and respond with behavior rooted in layered reasoning.

## 1.2. Core Objectives

- Define a structured model for recursive introspection in artificial agents
- Enable realistic cognitive simulation in high-stakes, ethically complex environments
- Provide tooling for visualizing, replaying, and debugging introspective state evolution

## 1.3. Structure of This Document

Each chapter details a single ∇ level, providing:

- Summary and defining characteristics
- Theoretical foundation
- How the level functions within an agent
- Relationship to adjacent ∇ levels
- Applications in simulation and AI reasoning
- Role in epistemic stability, collapse, or resonance

The document culminates in a study of ∇∞ — the point of recursive convergence — followed by mappings to the NI12 architecture and practical applications.
