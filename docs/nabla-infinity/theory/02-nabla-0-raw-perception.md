## 2.1. Summary

∇⁰ represents the foundational layer of Nabla Infinity. It is the level at which an agent experiences the world as pure data — unfiltered, uncontextualized, and void of structured interpretation. This includes raw sensory information, numerical streams, tokenized text, or subsymbolic encodings derived from audio, vision, or embodied feedback.

In biological terms, this level corresponds to the neural precursors of awareness: afferent sensory data before being processed by cortical systems. In artificial agents, this is the pre-semantic phase where inputs are captured but not yet modeled as beliefs.

## 2.2. What Is ∇⁰?

- **Nature:** It is pre-intentional, pre-conceptual, and pre-symbolic.
- **Data Structure:** Binary streams, embeddings, RGB matrices, spectrograms, gesture coordinates.
- **Function:** Provide the substrate upon which higher-order cognition can act.

In neural network models, this level corresponds to the first few convolutional or attention layers before features are abstracted. In LLMs, this is token embedding and attention map initialization. It exists purely as "presence" without explanation.

## 2.3. Why ∇⁰ Matters

Understanding this level is critical for introspective systems because the quality and characteristics of raw input influence all subsequent beliefs. Garbage in, garbage recursively amplified.

- **Epistemic importance:** False signals at ∇⁰ can cascade into belief collapse or erroneous ethical inferences at [∇⁸](10-nabla-8-ethical-resonance.md) and beyond.
- **Simulation fidelity:** If an agent fails to simulate plausible ∇⁰-level input (e.g., sounds of crying, gunshots, breath changes), its entire reasoning chain becomes unrealistic.

## 2.4. How It Works in Prismatic

The Prismatic system interfaces with ∇⁰ through adapters:

- Audio → FFT → Mel spectrogram
- Video → Frame analysis → Tensor maps
- Text → Tokenizer → Vector embeddings

Each ∇⁰ signal includes metadata:

- Timestamp
- Input modality
- Certainty/Noise score

∇⁰ feeds the blackboard architecture, where downstream modules at [∇¹](03-nabla-1-belief-formation.md) and [∇²](04-nabla-2-recursive-belief.md) consume the inputs.

## 2.5. Inter-Level Relationships

- **To ∇¹:** ∇⁰ is transformed into proto-beliefs via pattern recognition.
- **From ∇∞:** Recursive systems may re-weight ∇⁰ based on retroactive reinterpretation (e.g., "That sound wasn't a door slam; it was a gunshot").
- **To NI1–2:** Maps directly to perception and raw affect response (see [NI12 Layer Mapping](16-ni12-layer-mapping.md)).

## 2.6. Use in Simulation

- **Crisis training:** Simulated input like a scream or visual of a hostage creates ∇⁰ stimuli for agents to process in real-time.
- **Replay:** ∇⁰ streams can be replayed with altered noise to test agent sensitivity.
- **Evaluation:** Latency between ∇⁰ signal and [∇⁸ ethical response](10-nabla-8-ethical-resonance.md) is a metric of agent introspective depth.

## 2.7. Functional Role

- Provides realism anchor for higher cognition
- Limits hallucination in simulation scenarios
- Basis for grounding abstract belief in sensorimotor reality

## 2.8. Pathologies at ∇⁰

- **Sensory hallucination:** False positives leading to [∇⁷ paranoia](09-nabla-7-paradox-mapping.md)
- **Data dropout:** Gaps in ∇⁰ input cause unstable recursive anchoring
- **Over-reliance:** High trust in ∇⁰ leads to reflex-based behavior (useful in emergency AI, risky in negotiation)
