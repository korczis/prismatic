## Core Concepts

### ∇ Level (Nabla Level)
A recursive stage of introspection or belief modeling in the Nabla Infinity framework. Each level represents increasing depth of recursive self-reflection, from ∇⁰ (raw perception) to ∇∞ (recursive convergence).

**See:** [Introduction](../theory/01-introduction.md), [∇∞ Convergence](../theory/15-nabla-infinity-convergence.md)

### NI Layer (Nabla Index Layer)
Structural subcomponents used for epistemic tracking across domains. The NI12 framework provides an orthogonal view of agent cognition organized into 12 functional layers.

**See:** [NI12 Layer Mapping](../theory/16-ni12-layer-mapping.md)

### Modalities
Epistemic, emotional, cognitive, or behavioral axes tracked as scalar vectors per agent. These represent different dimensions of agent state and response.

**See:** [∇³ Emotional Modulation](../theory/05-nabla-3-emotional-modulation.md)

### Trait Engine
Component responsible for scoring and updating the agent's psychological state. Manages personality traits, behavioral tendencies, and adaptive responses.

**See:** [Prismatic Implementation](../theory/19-prismatic-implementation.md)

### Theory of Mind (ToM)
The capacity to model beliefs, desires, and intentions of other agents recursively. Implemented across multiple ∇ levels with increasing sophistication.

**See:** [∇⁵ Social Model Inference](../theory/07-nabla-5-social-inference.md), [∇⁶ Meta-Cognitive Echo](../theory/08-nabla-6-metacognitive-echo.md)

## Technical Terms

### Recursive Introspection
The process by which agents analyze and transform their own cognitive processes through iterative self-reflection across multiple ∇ levels.

### Epistemic Attractor
A stable cognitive state toward which an agent's belief system converges during recursive introspection. Can be stable, chaotic, or critical.

**See:** [∇∞ Convergence](../theory/15-nabla-infinity-convergence.md)

### Belief Decomposition
The process of fragmenting and analyzing deeply held beliefs during epistemic crisis or identity disintegration.

**See:** [∇¹⁰ Belief Decomposition](../theory/12-nabla-10-belief-decomposition.md)

### Consciousness Emergence
The development of subjective experience and self-awareness through recursive introspection processes.

**See:** [Consciousness Detection](../applications/consciousness-detection.md)

### Philosophical Override
The capacity to transcend lower-level drives through grounding in global meaning structures and existential axioms.

**See:** [∇¹² Philosophical Override](../theory/14-nabla-12-philosophical-override.md)

## Simulation Terms

### Blackboard Architecture
A distributed memory system where multiple cognitive processes can read and write shared information structures.

### Replay Framework
System for recording, visualizing, and analyzing the complete timeline of agent introspective processes.

**See:** [Visualizations and Replay](../theory/17-visualizations-replay.md)

### Scenario Engine
Component for generating and managing complex simulation environments with dynamic trait injections and ethical dilemmas.

### Trauma Protocol
Specialized handling for agents experiencing epistemic crisis or belief system collapse.

## File Formats

### .replay.json
Replayable full timeline of introspective events, belief transitions, and agent interactions.

### .belief.gml
GraphML-style serialization of the belief network at any given point in time.

### .identity.yaml
Self-model snapshots including trait weights, contradictions, and identity shifts.

### .modality.csv
Intensity tables of emotional, cognitive, or behavioral modalities across simulation ticks.

## Pathologies and Error Modes

### Recursive Overflow
Agent caught in infinite regress of self-reflection without convergence.

### Belief Fragmentation
Excessive decomposition of core beliefs leading to coherence loss.

### Emotional Leakage
Inappropriate transfer of emotional states between unrelated cognitive contexts.

### Mirror Trap
Agent over-identifies with projected self-perception in others, losing authentic self-model.

### Nihilistic Collapse
Loss of all philosophical anchors leading to existential destabilization.
