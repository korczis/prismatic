# Reasoning System Documentation

The reasoning system provides formal reasoning capabilities, logic engines, and inference mechanisms for intelligent decision-making and problem-solving.

## üìã Overview

The reasoning system enables:
- **Formal Logic**: Integration with Lean4, Prolog, and other formal reasoning systems
- **Inference Engines**: Rule-based reasoning and automated theorem proving
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Uncertainty handling and Bayesian inference
- **Causal Reasoning**: Understanding cause-effect relationships and interventions
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Time-aware planning and temporal logic
- **Abductive Reasoning**: Hypothesis generation and explanation finding

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The reasoning system integrates multiple reasoning paradigms and external reasoning engines while maintaining consistency with the Prismatic agent architecture.

## üéØ Implementation Status

- [ ] **Phase 5**: Reasoning Engine Integration
  - [ ] Lean4 integration for formal proofs
