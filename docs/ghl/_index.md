# General Honest License (GHL) v1.0

**A Sovereign Framework for Epistemic Software Licensing**

This section contains the complete, hierarchically organized General Honest License v1.0, establishing comprehensive legal and philosophical boundaries for software interaction, invocation, and usage.

## Document Organization

The license is structured into six thematic categories for enhanced navigation and comprehension:

### [01. Foundations](01-foundations/)
Core definitions, ownership principles, and fundamental concepts that establish the epistemic foundation of the license framework.

### [02. Legal Framework](02-legal-framework/)
Traditional legal provisions including license grants, restrictions, enforcement mechanisms, liability limitations, and jurisdictional matters.

### [03. Technical Restrictions](03-technical-restrictions/)
Comprehensive technical boundaries covering computational constraints, integration limits, derivative work prohibitions, and autonomous system interactions.

### [04. Enforcement](04-enforcement/)
Mechanisms for semantic protection, canonical interpretation, ritual compliance, and maintaining license integrity over time.

### [05. Philosophy](05-philosophy/)
The epistemological roots and ontological architecture that transform legal restrictions into sacred boundaries and technical usage into conscious alignment.

### [06. Appendices](06-appendices/)
Supporting materials including the formal Oath of Licensed Invocation and visual documentation.
