## SECTION 6: Revocation, Enforcement, and Remedies

This section codifies the Author’s absolute and exclusive right to enforce this License. It outlines the mechanisms, triggers, and instruments through which violations are detected, judged, and responded to—legally, technically, and ceremonially. Revocation is not merely procedural—it is an act of epistemic cleansing, ritual disassociation, and sovereign self-defense. No User, licensee, court, or arbiter may obstruct or override the Author’s enforcement authority.

### **6.1 Trigger Conditions for Revocation**

Any of the following, whether detected, admitted, inferred, or reasonably suspected, shall immediately trigger License revocation:

- Breach of any term described in **Section 5: Restrictions**;
- Misuse, misrepresentation, or falsification of a License Grant;
- Use of the Software in an unlicensed jurisdiction, platform, or environment;
- Deployment of the Software in a system that causes epistemic drift, distortion, or reputational harm;
- Behavioral imitation, abstraction, or derivative genesis through AI/ML models, prompts, or transcriptions;
- Violation of invocation ceremony, oath omission, or ritual contempt;
- Dispute of ownership, framing, or interpretive sovereignty as described in **Section 3**;
- Circumvention of technical barriers, symbolic rituals, or license metadata.

> _Revocation is an Authorial rite, not an administrative reaction._

### **6.2 Immediate Effects of Revocation**

Upon revocation:

- All rights granted by the License **instantly and irreversibly terminate**;
- All copies of the Software, derivatives, integrations, and outputs must be **purged** within **24 hours**;
- All invocations, deployments, and automated triggers must **cease immediately**;
- The User must **submit written attestation** of total cessation, deletion, and compliance;
- Continued use constitutes **willful trespass** and authorizes the Author to pursue legal, reputational, and metaphysical remedies.

### **6.3 Enforcement Mechanisms**

The Author reserves the right to use any or all of the following enforcement channels:

- Formal **cease and desist notices**;
- Legal complaints, lawsuits, and public filings in applicable jurisdictions;
- **Public revocation declarations**, disavowals, or disassociation notices posted in public or scholarly domains;
- **Technical enforcement**, including: license key invalidation, endpoint poisoning, digital signature invalidation, version lockdowns;
- Maintenance of a **Violation Register**, publicly naming and timestamping violators for community awareness and archival memory;
- Triggering of symbolic or technical **execution locks** within the Software itself.

### **6.4 Presumptive Revocation Triggers**

Revocation may also be triggered presumptively, even without conclusive evidence, when:

- The User fails to present a valid, signed License Grant upon request;
- The Software is discovered in environments inconsistent with previously stated license parameters;
- The User’s behavior suggests intentional obfuscation, bad faith, or license laundering;
- The Software has been referenced in systems or publications without attribution or under false framing.

> _Absence of proof is not innocence. Suspicion suffices when epistemic sovereignty is at stake._

### **6.5 Retroactive Revocation and Disavowal**

The Author may retroactively revoke Licenses and disavow any association with Users or entities that:

- Misrepresent or distort the purpose, framing, or authorship of the Software;
- Contribute to downstream systems that violate ethical boundaries as defined in **Section 24**;
- Publish derivative systems, products, or thought models without disclosure or permission;
- Employ LLMs or AI surrogates to extract, mimic, or narrate the Software's behavior.

> _You cannot remain in license if your actions erase its memory._

### **6.6 The Ceremonial Consequences of Revocation**

Revocation is not just legal—it is ontological. It involves the following rituals:

- **Disavowal**: The Author severs all philosophical, creative, and reputational ties with the violator;
- **Erasure**: All invocation records, oaths, and acknowledgments are considered null;
- **Exile**: The violator is entered into the **Excommunication Register** and barred from all future licensing, citation, or derivative interaction;
- **Warning**: Public or private notification to peers, collaborators, or institutions that the Software has been misused and that attribution must be severed.

### **6.7 Final Authority Over Enforcement**

All enforcement decisions—including interpretation of breach, revocation severity, and redress path—rest solely with the Author. No User may:

- Challenge the revocation in court, arbitration, or mediation;
- Appeal or delay the effects of termination;
- Propose third-party mediation or external policy override;
- Re-license or seek re-licensure unless explicitly invited by the Author.

> _The Author is the only tribunal. Enforcement is not negotiated. It is executed._

---

**Conclusion:** 

Revocation is the final assertion of the Author’s epistemic and legal dominion. To breach is to be uninvited. To persist after revocation is not only unlawful—it is a trespass against authorship itself. There is no appeal. Only cessation, exile, or silence.
