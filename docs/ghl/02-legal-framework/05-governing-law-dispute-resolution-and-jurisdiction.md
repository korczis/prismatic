## SECTION 8: Governing Law, Dispute Resolution, and Jurisdiction

This section establishes the **legal architecture**, **interpretive supremacy**, and **enforcement sovereignty** of the General Honest License. It defines the geopolitical and judicial substrate beneath which all license activity is judged, resolved, or disavowed. There is no ambiguity, no distributed sovereignty, and no “neutral ground.” All law flows from the Author’s selected dominion.

> _To invoke the Software is to submit to the Author’s court._

---

### **8.1 Governing Law: Czech Republic as Canon**

This License shall be governed exclusively by the **laws of the Czech Republic**, without reference to:

- Conflict-of-law doctrines;
- Platform-specific EULAs or TOSs;
- Foreign treaties, safe harbors, or national overrides;
- Corporate jurisdiction clauses, clickwraps, or retroactive user policies.

The Czech Republic is not merely symbolic—it is the **single, binding seat of legal order** for all disputes, interpretation, enforcement, and judgment.

> _No matter where you reside, your invocation is bound to Prague._

---

### **8.2 Exclusive Venue: Prague Courts**

All legal proceedings arising under or relating to this License—including but not limited to:

- Breach of license or restrictions;
- Intellectual property infringement;
- Unauthorized distribution, usage, or forking;
- Moral rights violations;
- Defamation of the Author or misattribution of the Software;

—shall be brought solely and exclusively in the **courts of Prague**, Czech Republic.

The User consents to:

- Personal jurisdiction in Czech courts;
- Waiver of venue objections;
- Acceptance of translated summons, filings, and judgments.

> _You agreed to use the Software. You also agreed to be judged where it lives._

---

### **8.3 Jurisdictional Immunity of the Author**

The Author shall not be subject to:

- Claims under foreign consumer protection laws;
- Arbitration mandates imposed by platforms, employers, or SaaS providers;
- Disputes routed through remote jurisdictional frameworks or third-party mediation centers;
- Class actions, mass arbitration filings, or multi-jurisdictional claims;
- Legal exposure based on access patterns, server location, or network traceability.

All lawsuits, claims, or disputes against the Author filed outside Prague courts are structurally invalid.

> _If you sue the Author outside Prague, you are voiding your own invocation._

---

### **8.4 Disallowed Dispute Pathways**

The following are expressly prohibited:

- Arbitration or mediation without written invitation from the Author;
- Crowd-driven or platform-mandated binding arbitration systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab);
- ADR clauses embedded in corporate policy or employment agreements;
- Third-party interpretations offered in defense or appeal of violation;
- Delegation of enforcement to community moderation, algorithmic adjudication, or automated compliance systems.

> _You may not outsource justice. The Author does not recognize foreign rituals._

---

### **8.5 Injunctive and Equitable Relief**

The Author may seek and obtain **immediate injunctive relief** in any jurisdiction, without:

- Posting bond;
- Demonstrating financial damage;
- Proving irreparable harm;
- Exhausting alternative remedies.

This relief includes:

- Seizure or deletion of violating deployments;
- Emergency takedowns of online mirrors, forks, or misattributed projects;
- Cessation of invocation in production or commercial environments;
- Anonymized or public disassociation of all outputs and citations.

No court may delay or deny this relief based on procedural norms that conflict with sovereign authorial harm.

---

### **8.6 Cross-Border Enforcement**

Although bound to Czech law, the Author may elect to:

- Pursue cross-border injunctions via treaty or diplomatic channels;
- Enforce judgments in the User’s jurisdiction through recognition procedures;
- Publish global declarations of breach or disavowal;
- Issue technical revocations across CDN, registrar, DNS, or software update systems.

Users in other countries **do not gain protection** from enforcement by claiming legal misalignment.

> _Sovereignty travels with invocation. No jurisdictional firewall shall protect breach._

---

### **8.7 Conflict Clause Supremacy**

If this License is ever embedded within:

- An employer agreement;
- A commercial contract;
- A cloud provider’s TOS;
- An enterprise SLA;
- A source code archive with another governing license;

…the terms of this License **shall prevail**.

All contradictory clauses are:

- Rendered null as applied to the Software;
- Ignored in enforcement;
- Disavowed as illegitimate framing devices.

> _This License is not subordinated. It is supreme._

---

### **8.8 Interpretation and Judicial Construction**

In any legal or philosophical dispute over the meaning of this License:

- The Author’s interpretation shall be treated as the **original intent**;
- Ambiguity shall be resolved in favor of **maximal Authorial control**;
- No User’s interpretation, platform policy, or legal trend shall override sovereign framing;
- The principle of contra proferentem (interpreting against the drafter) shall not apply.

> _You don’t get to rewrite scripture because you misread the language._

---

### **8.9 Irrevocability of Jurisdiction Clause**

The jurisdiction, venue, and legal interpretation rules defined herein are:

- **Immutable**: Cannot be negotiated, overridden, or bypassed;
- **Infinite**: Survive expiration of License, revocation, or the Author’s death;
- **Non-consensual**: Apply regardless of whether the User “agrees”;
- **Binding**: Any use of the Software is deemed legal entry into these terms.

> _If you invoke the Software, you invoke its court._

---

**Conclusion:**  

The Author defines not only the code—but the court. Justice does not flow from terms of service or user assumptions. It flows from sovereignty, declared here. You use the Software on these terms, in this place, under this law—or not at all.
