## SECTION 5: Restrictions

This section establishes the **absolute, sovereign, and non-negotiable prohibitions** governing all interactions with the Software. These restrictions are not mere legal boilerplate—they are the Author’s shield against dilution, expropriation, commodification, and epistemic trespass. All Users, whether human or non-human, authorized or unauthorized, must heed the following prohibitions with the utmost seriousness. **Any act not expressly permitted by a valid License Grant is categorically forbidden.**

### **5.1 Prohibited Activities: General**

The following activities are strictly and perpetually prohibited unless explicitly authorized in a formal, signed License Grant:

- **Copying and Redistribution**
    - Reproducing, duplicating, archiving, or backing up any part of the Software, in whole or in part.
    - Distributing, sharing, or transmitting the Software to any third party, by any means, including but not limited to electronic, physical, or ephemeral channels.
    - Uploading, posting, or mirroring the Software on public or private repositories, file-sharing platforms, or cloud storage.

- **Modification and Derivative Creation**
    - Altering, adapting, transforming, porting, refactoring, or otherwise modifying the Software or any of its components.
    - Creating derivative works, forks, translations, or reinterpretations in any language, framework, or paradigm.
    - Incorporating any part of the Software into other software, scripts, libraries, or systems.

- **Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly**
    - Analyzing, decompiling, disassembling, tracing, or otherwise attempting to reconstruct the Software’s source, structure, logic, or behavior.
    - Extracting algorithms, data structures, or design patterns from the Software by any technical, forensic, or observational means.
    - Using debugging tools, profilers, or memory dumps to infer internal mechanisms or confidential information.

- **Execution Outside of License Scope**
    - Running, invoking, or executing the Software in any environment, context, or scale not explicitly described in a valid License Grant.
    - Deploying the Software in production, test, development, or experimental environments beyond the boundaries of the granted license.
    - Allowing indirect invocation by automation, batch jobs, pipelines, or third-party triggers not named in the License Grant.

- **Use in AI/ML Training and Model Generation**
    - Utilizing the Software, its outputs, documentation, or any representation thereof as training data, evaluation material, or prompt context for any artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, or data mining system.
    - Feeding, referencing, or exposing the Software to large language models (LLMs), generative AI, or automated code generation systems.
    - Using the Software as a behavioral oracle, test set, or gold standard for AI/ML model development, benchmarking, or fine-tuning.

- **API Exposure, Proxying, and Mirroring**
    - Wrapping, exposing, or integrating the Software via APIs, RPC endpoints, web services, or any form of programmatic interface accessible by third parties.
    - Proxying, tunneling, or relaying requests to the Software from unlicensed Users, systems, or networks.
    - Mirroring, caching, or replicating the Software’s behavior, outputs, or responses for use by unauthorized entities.

- **Behavioral Imitation, Prompt-Based Reconstruction, and Simulation**
    - Observing, logging, or recording the Software’s behavior, outputs, or error conditions for the purpose of imitation, emulation, or simulation.
    - Using prompt engineering, behavioral analysis, or interactive sessions to reconstruct the Software’s logic, responses, or user experience.
    - Training humans, machines, or hybrid systems to mimic, simulate, or approximate the Software’s operation, output patterns, or epistemic frame.

- **Indirect, Incidental, or Facilitated Prohibited Acts**
    - Encouraging, facilitating, or enabling any third party to perform any of the above-restricted activities.
    - Circumventing technical, legal, or ceremonial boundaries by means of abstraction, indirection, or obfuscation.
    - Using the Software as a scaffold, template, or inspiration for the creation of functionally similar or competitive systems.

### **5.2 Nested Prohibitions and Expanded Coverage**

The above restrictions apply not only to the Software as a whole, but to:
- All constituent files, modules, dependencies, and documentation.
- All outputs, logs, reports, or artifacts generated by or through the Software.
- All representations, transcriptions, screenshots, or memory-based recreations.
- All forks, branches, or derivatives, regardless of degree of transformation or obfuscation.

**Prohibitions extend recursively** to:
- Any system, tool, or agent that interacts with, learns from, or is influenced by the Software.
- All downstream products, services, or knowledge artifacts that would not exist but for exposure to the Software.

### **5.3 Sovereign Declarations of Prohibition**

- **No act of copying, redistribution, modification, or reverse engineering is ever presumed to be permitted.**
- **No execution, invocation, or integration outside the precise Scope of Use is tolerated.**
- **No use of the Software in any AI/ML context, for any training, inference, or modeling purpose, is allowed under any circumstance.**
- **No API exposure, proxying, or behavioral mirroring is authorized.**
- **No behavioral imitation, prompt-based reconstruction, or simulation—manual or automated—is sanctioned.**
- **No circumvention by abstraction, indirection, or technical trickery will be recognized as legitimate.**

### **5.4 Ritual and Ceremonial Affirmation**

These restrictions are not mere legalisms—they are the **ritual boundaries** that defend the Author’s frame, intent, and sovereignty. They are **absolute** and **eternal** unless the Author, by notarized and public act, chooses to amend them.

**Ceremonial Reaffirmation:**All restrictions enumerated herein are essential to uphold the sanctity, integrity, and metaphysical architecture of the Software. They are the Author’s shield against entropy, dilution, and expropriation. **To violate these restrictions is to trespass not only against law, but against the very order of authorship.**
