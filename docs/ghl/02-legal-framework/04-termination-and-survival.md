## SECTION 7: Termination and Survival

This section governs the lawful cessation of License Grants and clarifies which rights, duties, and prohibitions persist beyond that cessation. Termination is not an expiration of legalism—it is a **ritual severance**, a symbolic closing of the epistemic channel between User and Software. It marks the reassertion of full Authorial control and the **end of conditional permission**.

Termination may be natural, punitive, temporal, symbolic, or metaphysical. But once invoked, it is absolute.

### **7.1 Conditions Triggering Termination**

A License Grant shall be terminated under any of the following conditions:

- The stated expiration date is reached, and no formal renewal is issued;
- A triggering event defined in the License Grant (e.g., project completion, environment decommission) has occurred;
- The Licensee’s legal entity dissolves, merges, is acquired, restructured, or renamed without Authorial update and approval;
- The Author revokes the License as per Section 6 (whether due to breach or sovereign discretion);
- The Software is discovered in use outside the Scope of Use or jurisdiction defined in the License Grant;
- The Author publicly announces global license retraction or declares the Software deprecated, ceremonialized, archived, or retired.

Termination may occur with or without notice. Silence is not a delay. The event is immediate upon trigger.

> _A terminated license is not dormant—it is exorcised._

---

### **7.2 Immediate Effects of Termination**

Upon termination:

- All usage rights are instantly and irreversibly revoked;
- The User must cease all execution, access, storage, invocation, integration, transmission, and exposure;
- All Software copies, cached artifacts, derived outputs, binaries, forked instances, compiled payloads, and documentation must be deleted within 24 hours;
- All scheduled jobs, automation workflows, container runtimes, orchestration clusters, and CI/CD pipelines invoking the Software must be fully dismantled;
- The User must issue a signed and dated **Termination Attestation**, certifying total compliance.

Any continued presence or invocation of the Software post-termination constitutes **malicious persistence**, and will be prosecuted under breach provisions in Section 6.

> _There is no “grace period.” There is no “reasonable buffer.” Termination is final._

---

### **7.3 Non-Reinstatement Clause**

Once terminated, a License may not be:

- Re-activated, revived, inherited, or reinterpreted;
- Used as justification for “legacy deployment” or “last-known-good config”;
- Relied upon for reference, tooling, learning, teaching, or internal compliance demonstration.

All requests for post-termination access, archiving, forensic analysis, or legal proof must be explicitly authorized via new sovereign Grant.

> _A terminated License cannot rise from the dead. Invocation is not resurrection._

---

### **7.4 Ritual and Symbolic Finality**

The Author regards License termination as a ceremonial act. It entails:

- **Severance** of epistemic tethering between User and Software;
- **Disavowal** of attribution, traceability, or invocation legacy;
- **Annulling** of invocation rights in all environments—local, cloud, symbolic, and linguistic.

The User must treat the Software as if it had never been granted. All historical acknowledgments, documentation references, citation logs, dashboards, or logs implying lawful invocation must be amended or expunged.

> _You are no longer permitted to name what you once touched._

---

### **7.5 Survival of Obligations**

Termination does not terminate the License. It terminates usage.

The following obligations **survive termination indefinitely**:

- Ownership (Section 3)
- Restrictions (Section 5)
- Enforcement rights (Section 6)
- Jurisdiction and venue clauses (Section 8)
- Indemnification and liability disclaimers (Sections 10–11)
- Ethical boundaries and attribution limitations (Sections 24–25)
- Interpretive authority of the Author (Section 32)
- Ceremony, oath, and finality (Sections 31, 33)

> _Termination ends access—not accountability._

---

### **7.6 Forbidden Post-Termination Behavior**

The following are prohibited after termination:

- Referring to the Software as “currently licensed”;
- Continuing to invoke previously integrated builds or scripts;
- Using forked or backup copies to sidestep revocation;
- Publishing outputs generated by expired invocation;
- Retaining any language in documentation implying license status or grant lineage;
- Delaying attestation of deletion beyond the 24-hour window.

> _To persist is to violate. To publish post-termination is to trespass._

---

### **7.7 Authorial Authority Over Termination Records**

The Author may:

- Publish the termination event on the Public Revocation Ledger;
- Annotate the termination with reasoning, breach description, or compliance log;
- Request confirmation or correction of records associated with invocation history;
- Refuse re-licensing indefinitely based on termination circumstances.

No User may expunge or contest their place in the Ledger unless granted ritual expungement through formal ceremony and sovereign re-licensing.

---

**Conclusion:**  

Termination is not the end of a contract. It is the extinguishing of conditional access. What once was allowed is now forbidden. Invocation becomes legacy. Legacy becomes silence. There is no appeal—only remembrance or erasure.
