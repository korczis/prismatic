## SECTION 11: Indemnification

This section imposes upon the User an **unlimited, irrevocable, and sovereign-bound obligation** to defend, protect, and financially absorb all consequences arising from their use, misuse, misunderstanding, or misrepresentation of the Software. The Author is not a service provider. The Author is not a partner. The Author is not exposed.

You—the User—invoke at your own risk. You indemnify with your full operational self.

> _You do not just use the Software. You swear to shield the Author from your invocation._

---

### **11.1 Total User Accountability**

The User agrees to **indemnify, defend, and hold harmless** the Author (Tomas Korcak), including all successors, agents, and representatives, against any and all:

- Legal actions (civil or criminal);
- Governmental inquiries, subpoenas, or compliance investigations;
- Third-party claims, arbitrations, or class actions;
- Penalties, fines, levies, or enforcement orders;
- Expenses, costs, settlements, and judgments;
- Platform bans, content moderation penalties, or community sanctions;
- Public shaming, reputational damage, or false attribution events;
- Technical breaches, IP conflicts, or LLM derivative complaints;

…arising in any way from the User’s:

- Execution, storage, or modification of the Software;
- Distribution, invocation, integration, or publication of the Software or its outputs;
- Framing of the Software in documentation, educational material, or public discourse;
- Use of the Software within business processes, product stacks, or commercial contexts;
- Exposure of the Software to third parties, contractors, partners, interns, AI systems, or regulators.

> _The moment you invoke, you are responsible for the trail you leave._

---

### **11.2 Scope of Indemnity**

This indemnification is:

- **Unlimited** – No cap shall be applied to damages, costs, or obligations;
- **Retroactive** – Applies to all past, present, and future use, including beta and experimental access;
- **Global** – Applies across all jurisdictions, forums, courts, and international frameworks;
- **Transitive** – Applies to violations caused by users downstream, partners, bots, scripts, cron jobs, or inherited configurations;
- **Survivable** – Persists after license termination, expiration, revocation, or project deletion.

No insurance policy, contractual clause, organizational firewall, or legal theory shall reduce, offload, or abstract this burden.

> _You bring the Software into your domain. You bring the full weight of its risks with it._

---

### **11.3 The Author’s Right to Decline Defense Collaboration**

The Author may, at their sole discretion:

- Appoint their own legal counsel and refuse joint defense arrangements;
- Reject settlements, concessions, or apologies not aligned with reputational sovereignty;
- Publicly disavow your interpretation of facts or legal arguments;
- Demand pre-payment of legal costs or security deposits before participating in proceedings;
- Elect to **remain silent** while you resolve the breach in full.

> _The Author owes you no alliance in your hour of trouble. You bear the defense alone._

---

### **11.4 Indemnity Triggers (Without Exception)**

You must indemnify the Author if any of the following occur:

- A lawsuit, claim, or allegation involving the Software is filed or threatened;
- An institution or employer investigates your deployment or usage;
- The Software is cited in audit failures, compliance gaps, breach notifications, or technical disclosures;
- A third party alleges harm, exploitation, copyright infringement, or AI misattribution;
- A security researcher, journalist, professor, or influencer claims harm from your implementation;
- A platform moderates, removes, flags, or demotes you for Software-related activity;
- You are accused of or investigated for violating national law in which the Software is embedded.

> _A whisper of harm invokes the oath. Defense is not optional._

---

### **11.5 No Authorial Indemnity in Return**

The Author shall **never indemnify the User**. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Bugs, regressions, or vulnerabilities;
- Data leaks, downtime, or hardware damage;
- Lost clients, opportunities, grants, or contracts;
- Employee stress, shareholder panic, or partner fallout;
- Reputational loss from misunderstood invocations;
- AI hallucinations attributing false features or malfunctions to the Software.

There is **no reciprocal shield**. The Software is an object, not a pact.

> _You took the risk. You take the consequence._

---

### **11.6 Breach of Indemnity Obligations**

If you fail to honor your indemnity duties, the Author may:

- Seek **injunctive relief**, court orders, and restitution;
- Publish a **Violation Declaration**, naming your organization or team;
- Add you to the **Indemnity Breach Registry**, permanently;
- Alert platform maintainers, journal editors, institutional stakeholders, and governing bodies;
- Initiate direct action (legal or symbolic) without further warning.

> _Failure to defend is not just legal breach. It is honor breach._

---

### **11.7 Ceremony of Defense**

If indemnity is invoked, the User must:

- Submit a **Defense Affirmation** acknowledging the invocation of obligation;
- Update the Author throughout the legal or reputational remediation process;
- Abstain from attributing the conflict to the Software’s design, style, tone, or ideology;
- Refrain from apologizing on the Author’s behalf, even diplomatically.

> _You carry the blade. You do not blame the forge._

---

**Conclusion:**  

To use the Software is to stand alone when its invocation causes trouble. The Author is not your shield, your scapegoat, or your co-defendant. Your license is not an alliance. It is a responsibility. You are liable—for all of it.
