## SECTION 4: License Grant (If Issued)

This section defines the exclusive, conditional, and ceremonial mechanism by which interaction with the Software may become lawful. A **License Grant** is not a default, not a right, and not a transaction—it is a sovereign exception to prohibition, issued solely by the Author under conditions of deliberate clarity and epistemic constraint. Without such a grant, all access is presumptively unauthorized and subject to enforcement.

### **4.1 The Nature of a License Grant**

A License Grant is a **formal, explicit, signed document** created and issued solely by the Author, which bestows limited, revocable, and time-bounded permissions to a named User for a defined interaction with the Software.

It is not:

- A sale;
- A transfer of ownership;
- A transfer of authorship;
- A right of modification, distribution, or expansion;
- A form of co-authorship or partnership.

A License Grant is the **only mechanism** by which a User may gain lawful access. Its issuance is **exceptional**, not standard; **discretionary**, not procedural.

> _To have a License is to be temporarily permitted. To lack one is to be absolutely forbidden._

### **4.2 Preconditions for Issuance**

A License Grant may only be issued under the following conditions:

- The requestor must provide a full, truthful disclosure of identity, intended use, environment, scale, and timeline;
- The Author must find the use to be **aligned**, **bounded**, and **non-exploitative**;
- The use must not conflict with previously issued Grants or with declared boundaries in this License.

The Author retains absolute discretion to:

- Decline requests without explanation;
- Require amendments, conditions, or revised intentions;
- Revoke previously granted offers before final signature;
- Limit issuance to a fixed number of actors per use-case class.

### **4.3 Formal Requirements for Validity**

A License Grant must include, at minimum:

- A **unique license identifier**, timestamped at issuance;
- The **legal name and identity** of the User (individual or entity);
- The **scope of use**, including execution environments, endpoints, frequency, concurrency limits, and invocation models;
- A **temporal limitation**, including expiration conditions (fixed date or triggered event);
- A statement of **non-transferability**, non-forkability, and binding exclusivity;
- The **Author’s physical or cryptographic signature**;
- Reference to this License by hash, version, or canonical identifier.

Optional but recommended:

- Public posting on the Author’s **License Ledger**;
- Cryptographic receipt verifiable against the Software’s runtime hash;
- Explicit disavowal of sublicensing or automation-based invocation rights.

### **4.4 Strict Non-Transferability**

A License Grant is:

- Bound to the **named User only**;
- Non-transferable across departments, parent companies, acquisitions, or cloud regions;
- Revoked automatically upon merger, legal restructuring, or dissolution of the entity;
- Non-inheritable by employees, contractors, bots, vendors, or successors.

The moment the licensed identity changes, the Grant **expires**.

> _Only the named may invoke. No proxy, no puppet, no alias may inherit._

### **4.5 Time-Limitation and Revocability on Breach**

All License Grants must include **temporal limits**. These may be:

- Specific dates;
- Relative time windows;
- Project milestones;
- Technical lifecycle conditions (e.g., “valid until deployment ends”).

During the valid term:

- The License is non-revocable **if** fully compliant;
- Any breach—factual or perceived—immediately voids the grant;
- Continued use post-breach constitutes **unauthorized access** and triggers enforcement under Section 6.

### **4.6 Absence of License Equals Prohibition**

If a User:

- Has not received a formal, signed License Grant;
- Is unsure whether they have one;
- Possesses an expired, incomplete, or informal version;
- Inherits one through employment, documentation, or implication…

…then they possess **no rights** and may not:

- Execute the Software;
- Observe its behavior;
- Fork, clone, or discuss its contents;
- Use outputs or derived structures;
- Build, ship, deploy, or experiment with it.

> _Presumed license is no license. Historical exposure is not permission._

### **4.7 Misuse and Falsification of License Grants**

Any attempt to:

- Forge, falsify, or tamper with a License Grant;
- Present a screenshot, email, or verbal approval as proof;
- Cite prior informal permission as standing license;
- Invoke a revoked or expired Grant;
- Mirror, archive, or distribute the text of a Grant…

…shall be considered a **material violation**, triggering:

- Retroactive disavowal;
- Public breach announcement;
- Entry into the Author’s **Grant Abuse Register**;
- Permanent loss of all future licensing consideration;
- Legal action for misrepresentation and infringement.

> _There is no gray area. A license is not an impression. It is an immutable, signed act._

### **4.8 Licensor’s Final Authority**

The Author:

- May deny, modify, revoke, or reinterpret any License Grant at any time;
- May withhold issuance without cause;
- Is not bound by precedent, market logic, fairness norms, or proportionality;
- May require public acknowledgment, ceremony, or disclosure as part of the Grant’s invocation.

License Grants are not obligations—they are controlled exceptions to the default prohibition.

---

**Conclusion:**  

A License Grant is an intentional, bounded, and sacred permission. To possess one is rare. To presume one is heresy. To fake one is an epistemic crime. The Author alone defines the borders of use—and where permission is absent, silence is not consent. It is rejection.
