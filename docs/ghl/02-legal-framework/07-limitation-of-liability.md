## SECTION 10: Limitation of Liability

This section establishes the absolute limits of the Author’s liability, obligation, duty of care, and exposure to claims, disputes, or expectations of remediation. It is not a courtesy disclaimer. It is a declaration of **ontological separation**. The Software exists under the will of the Author—but the consequences of its use exist **solely in the realm of the User**.

> _You were warned. You are not owed._

---

### **10.1 No Warranty: Total Disclaimers of Assurance**

The Software is provided **“AS IS”**, without any representation or warranty, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Merchantability;
- Fitness for a particular purpose;
- Accuracy, reliability, or correctness;
- Non-infringement of third-party rights;
- Security, resilience, or recoverability;
- Compatibility with standards, ecosystems, or expectations.

The Author explicitly disclaims any responsibility for:

- Functionality that was expected but not delivered;
- Documentation accuracy or completeness;
- Performance under load, concurrency, or scaling conditions;
- Support, bug fixing, maintenance, or backward compatibility.

> _What you receive is what was authored. What you expected is your invention._

---

### **10.2 No Liability for Damage or Consequence**

The Author shall **not** be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from or related to the Software, including but not limited to:

- Data loss, corruption, or leakage;
- Revenue loss, business interruption, or strategic compromise;
- System crashes, outages, or failure cascades;
- Legal exposure due to audit failure, regulatory noncompliance, or third-party integration;
- Harm to reputation, investor confidence, team morale, or intellectual standing;
- Any act of epistemic misalignment or user error in execution.

This exclusion applies **even if**:

- The Author was advised of the possibility of such damages;
- The Software was used in a high-risk or mission-critical environment;
- The failure stemmed from a known bug or documented limitation;
- The defect was inherent to an architectural decision.

> _To use the Software is to accept the risk. The Author accepts none._

---

### **10.3 Forbidden Use in Critical Systems**

The Software must not be used in:

- Medical devices or diagnostic systems;
- Military systems, tactical applications, or autonomous weapons;
- Air traffic control, automotive control systems, or transportation infrastructure;
- Financial systems involving live markets, trading, or asset custody;
- Nuclear, energy grid, or national defense systems;
- Real-time decision-making systems where error equals harm.

If you violate this and harm occurs, **you accept all liability**, criminal and civil.

> _This is not safety-critical software. If life, limb, or society is at risk, you have already breached._

---

### **10.4 No Authorial Responsibility for User Context**

The Author is not responsible for:

- The User’s business models, operational architecture, or decision frameworks;
- Integration bugs, pipeline instability, or runtime misconfigurations;
- Security flaws introduced during deployment;
- Latency, throughput, or UX regressions when embedded;
- Outcomes caused by missing features or unaligned design assumptions.

The burden is on the User to:

- Evaluate suitability;
- Test in context;
- Monitor effects;
- Accept risk.

> _The Author does not ride along. If it breaks in your world, it broke on your watch._

---

### **10.5 No Interpretive Liability**

The Author shall not be liable for:

- Misunderstanding of documentation;
- Errors in reading or implementing examples;
- Confusion about the metaphors, terminologies, or architectural conventions used;
- Reinterpretation of scope, boundaries, or ceremonial clauses;
- Educational outcomes or onboarding failures.

Even the clearest License cannot protect against **User epistemic failure**.

> _You misunderstood the map. The cartographer is not to blame._

---

### **10.6 Survival of Disclaimers**

All limitations of liability and disclaimers in this section:

- Survive License revocation, termination, or expiration;
- Apply retroactively and prospectively;
- Extend to all forks, ports, transpilations, and translations of the Software;
- Apply even if national laws claim to guarantee implied warranties (to the extent permitted);
- Are cumulative across all versions and contexts.

> _Disclaimers are not time-limited. They are structural._

---

### **10.7 Aesthetic and Philosophical Detachment**

The Software is not:

- An endorsement of the User’s goals, architecture, or industry;
- A statement of values, political positions, or affiliations;
- A commitment to co-create, iterate, or participate;
- A performance contract or service offering.

Its mere inclusion in a system does not grant credibility, authority, or alignment with the Author’s intentions.

> _You may use the Software. But you may not claim kinship._

---

**Conclusion:**  

The Author offers a tool—not a shield. A boundary—not a promise. If the Software harms, confuses, or collapses your work, that is the price of autonomous invocation. You may claim the benefits. You may not outsource the costs.
