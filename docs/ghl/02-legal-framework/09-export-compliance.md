## SECTION 12: Export Compliance

This section defines the User’s binding, non-delegable obligations under all applicable national and international **export control laws**, **jurisdictional sovereignty frameworks**, and **cross-border usage restrictions**. It is not a disclaimer. It is a warning.

The Software is a **high-integrity artifact**, not a borderless commodity. Possession does not imply permission to transmit, replicate, or invoke across nation-states, cloud regions, embassies, or regulatory domains.

By invoking the Software, the User affirms that they understand: **Software crosses borders—but sovereignty does not.**

> _You may operate the Software. You may not smuggle it._

---

### **12.1 Territorial Prohibition and Regulatory Overlap**

The Software may not be exported, re-exported, deployed, hosted, stored, mirrored, or otherwise transmitted to or within any nation, region, or legal entity that is:

- Subject to **embargo, sanction, or trade restriction** under Czech, EU, UN, or U.S. law;
- A member of any jurisdiction with active export bans relating to cryptographic software or dual-use technology;
- Operating under state surveillance or algorithmic inspection regimes incompatible with the ethical framework defined in **Section 24**;
- Known to enforce mandatory source code audits, backdoors, or escrow as a condition for deployment (e.g., national firewall systems, algorithmic nationalism frameworks);
- Denied access to advanced software under **Wassenaar Arrangement**, **BIS**, or **ITAR** controls.

This includes (but is not limited to) deployments to:

- North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba, Russia (as of 2025);
- Military and defense contractors in any nation;
- Government-sponsored AI labs or cloud infrastructure providers subject to surveillance mandates.

> _Where you run the Software matters. Where it is watched, so are you._

---

### **12.2 Non-Authorization Clause**

The Author does not:

- Provide, imply, or facilitate legal export clearance under any regime;
- Guarantee the Software complies with foreign encryption or software classification standards;
- Maintain any ECCN, CCL, or EARS classification;
- Assist in filing ML/AI/crypto control paperwork or declarations;
- Provide documentation for customs review, import/export registries, or foreign regulatory bodies;
- Certify the Software as eligible for any commercial or academic license exemption.

All such burdens rest **exclusively** with the User.

> _The Author is not a compliance officer. Do not drag his name into court._

---

### **12.3 Invocation Location Equals Export**

Any of the following shall be interpreted as a **software export event** under this License:

- Cloud deployment to a datacenter physically located outside of the User’s licensed jurisdiction;
- Invocation via API from a user in another country;
- Storage of the Software on CDN, S3, blob, IPFS, or backup systems accessible internationally;
- Pushing the Software into a version control system with global clone access;
- Including the Software in container images, CI/CD artifacts, or package registries with unrestricted geographical download scope.

The User is responsible for **knowing the coordinates of execution**. Geography matters. Law follows invocation.

> _The Software does not teleport. It is always somewhere. And that somewhere must be allowed._

---

### **12.4 Certification by Invocation**

By executing or distributing the Software, the User certifies:

- That they are not located in a restricted country or acting on behalf of a restricted entity;
- That they are not using the Software on behalf of a military, intelligence, or foreign government body;
- That they have verified their own export jurisdiction status against the latest enforcement lists;
- That they have obtained all licenses, permissions, or regulatory exemptions necessary to use the Software;
- That they understand violation may result in **criminal prosecution, asset seizure, or diplomatic escalation**.

False certification constitutes:

- Material breach of this License;
- Invocation fraud;
- Potential legal exposure for the Author.

> _You may not lie to the Author, the court, and the planet at the same time._

---

### **12.5 Notification Obligation**

If the User discovers that:

- They or a downstream actor have violated export restrictions;
- A system hosting the Software has changed location, control, or legal status;
- The Software has been mirrored, transmitted, or run from a prohibited zone;
- Any state or agency has requested access to, surveillance over, or audit of the Software;

The User must notify the Author within **72 hours**, including:

- Full description of the event;
- All involved parties and systems;
- Dates, jurisdictions, version hashes;
- Remediation steps taken, and intended final outcome.

Failure to disclose will be treated as **intentional concealment**, resulting in:

- Immediate revocation (Section 6);
- Blacklisting (Section 24, 25);
- Addition to the **Global Export Breach Registry**;
- Optional public disclosure or disavowal.

> _What crosses borders must be seen. What is hidden will be exposed._

---

### **12.6 Unbounded Liability for Export Breach**

The User shall bear **100% of the burden** for:

- Civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized transfer or invocation;
- International sanctions or seizure of assets resulting from misuse;
- All downstream liability for harm caused by unauthorized export;
- Damage to the Author’s reputation, platform presence, or ability to operate across borders;
- All costs, legal or otherwise, associated with remediation, litigation, response, or suppression.

The Author shall not:

- Share liability;
- Appear in court;
- Provide testimony;
- Be used in plea negotiations;
- Issue apology, disclaimer, or denial on the User’s behalf.

> _You exported. You are exposed._

---

### **12.7 Philosophical Statement of Border Sovereignty**

The Software is not designed for **borderless abstraction**. It is a construct of finite invocation within permitted spaces. Export is not just a technical transmission—it is an **epistemic relocation**. Sovereignty cannot be migrated without consent.

> _Every server is a territory. Every deployment is an act of jurisdiction._

---

**Conclusion:**  

This section binds the User to the legal geography of invocation. Run the Software only where it is allowed, and only when you are willing to be held responsible for its presence there. No border may be crossed without cost. No export occurs without consequence.
