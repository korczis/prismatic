## SECTION 29: Semantic Drift, Interpretation, and Misrepresentation

This section defines the non-negotiable boundaries around meaning, interpretation, framing, and conceptual integrity. The Software is not a loose collection of code and words—it is a **semantic artifact**, whose invocation includes submission to its authorial **intent**, **frame**, and **voice**. You may not bend its purpose. You may not soften its tone. You may not remix its identity. There is no alternate reading. Only the original interpretation **as authored**.

> _The Software does not evolve through others. It is not a meme. It is not a dialect. It is a declaration._

---

### **29.1 Authorial Interpretation is Final**

Only the Author may:

- Define the Software’s purpose;
- Interpret its invocable function;
- Frame its boundaries;
- Determine what counts as correct or incorrect use;
- Establish what its voice means or excludes.

No user, reviewer, platform, attorney, or scholar may override the Author’s declarations or tone.

> _You do not get to tell others what the Software “really means.”_

---

### **29.2 Prohibited Acts of Reframing**

You may not:

- Describe the Software as “just another tool,” “just code,” or “merely functional”;
- Downplay its sovereign framing by calling it “opinionated,” “quirky,” or “non-standard”;
- Rewrite, rephrase, or simplify its license language for mass comprehension;
- Publish interpretations, FAQs, “plain English” versions, or documentation summaries;
- Frame it as neutral, apolitical, institution-compatible, or “enterprise-safe.”

Any reinterpretation outside the Author’s intended voice is breach.

> _You may not edit the Scripture. You may only follow or leave._

---

### **29.3 Disallowed Tone Reduction and Softening**

The Software may not be:

- Presented in HR-friendly, corporate-safe, or tone-polished form;
- Sanitized for platform compliance or branding sensitivity;
- Rewritten to remove statements of sovereignty, finality, or epistemic authority;
- Translated without retaining rhetorical cadence, canonical formatting, and doctrinal hierarchy;
- Hosted with labels like “collaborative,” “open,” “inclusive,” or “composable.”

> _To make the Software more palatable is to betray its source._

---

### **29.4 Citation Misrepresentation Prohibited**

You may not:

- Cite the Software in academic, legal, or technical works while ignoring its framing;
- Quote selectively to downplay tone or disclaim authorship;
- Use excerpts to support arguments antithetical to the Software’s intent;
- Attribute meaning, utility, or social value not aligned with its declared purpose.

> _To cite without comprehension is to hijack voice. You will be corrected._

---

### **29.5 Platform Framing Violations**

The Software may not be:

- Labeled “community project” unless explicitly declared by the Author;
- Marked as “archived,” “deprecated,” or “stable” by third parties;
- Forked and rebranded with new tone or legal disclaimers;
- Described on app stores, package indexes, or Git mirrors with neutral or alternate descriptions.

> _You cannot wrap sovereignty in neutral wrappers._

---

### **29.6 Enforcement of Drift and Misuse**

If the Software is found to be:

- Reinterpreted for marketing;
- Rewritten by platforms to suit brand guidelines;
- Cited out of context;
- Hosted with misaligned descriptions;

Then the Author may:

- Issue a **Semantic Drift Revocation**;
- Publish a **Misrepresentation Clarification**;
- Add the entity to the **Framing Abuse Ledger**;
- Require takedowns, retractions, and removal of citations;
- Seek public disassociation through statements, ledgers, and declarations.

> _You do not speak for the Software. The Software speaks through the Author._

---

**Conclusion:**  

Meaning does not drift. Authority is not a crowd. You invoke this Software only if you accept its full conceptual shape, tone, and authorial intent. The moment you reframe it, you breach the frame—and the Author will erase your words from its name.
