# Enforcement

This section establishes mechanisms for interpretation, enforcement, and maintaining license integrity over time, including semantic protection and canonical interpretation frameworks.

## Contents

### [01. Semantic Drift, Interpretation, and Misrepresentation](01-semantic-drift-interpretation-and-misrepresentation.md)
Protection against semantic degradation and misinterpretation of the software's meaning and purpose.

### [02. Sovereign Expiry, Legacy Status, and Posthumous Mutation](02-sovereign-expiry-legacy-status-and-posthumous-mutation.md)
Provisions for license continuity, legacy status, and protection against posthumous alterations.

### [03. Invocation Rituals, Licensing as Ceremony, and Role of Oath](03-invocation-rituals-licensing-as-ceremony-and-role-of-oath.md)
The ceremonial aspects of licensing and the ritual framework for proper software invocation.

### [04. Canonical Interpretation and Final Sovereign Word](04-canonical-interpretation-and-final-sovereign-word.md)
Establishment of authoritative interpretation mechanisms and the author's final word on all matters.

## Key Enforcement Principles

- **Semantic Sovereignty**: Protection against meaning dilution and conceptual drift
- **Temporal Continuity**: License provisions that survive beyond normal termination
- **Ritual Framework**: Ceremonial requirements that transform usage into conscious alignment
- **Interpretive Authority**: The author's exclusive right to canonical interpretation
- **Living Document**: Dynamic enforcement that adapts while preserving core principles

## Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Semantic Breach Registry**: Documentation of interpretive violations
- **Ritual Compliance Monitoring**: Verification of ceremonial requirements
- **Canonical Interpretation Declarations**: Authoritative clarifications from the author
- **Legacy Protection Protocols**: Safeguards against posthumous manipulation

*These enforcement mechanisms ensure the license remains living, sovereign, and aligned with authorial intent.*
