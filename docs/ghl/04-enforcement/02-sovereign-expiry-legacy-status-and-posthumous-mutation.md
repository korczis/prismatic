## SECTION 30: Sovereign Expiry, Legacy Status, and Posthumous Mutation

This section defines the only conditions under which the Software may expire, be retired, declared legacy, or altered after the Author’s death or departure. The Software is not subject to organic decay, community takeover, or “end-of-life” assumptions. There is no fork-on-death clause. There is no “let the community decide.” The Author’s control does not die when the Author does. It is embedded in the Software itself.

> _You do not outlive the license. You do not inherit the frame. Sovereignty does not decompose._

---

### **30.1 No Community Custodianship Upon Author’s Death**

The Software shall not:

- Be passed on to community maintainers;
- Be forked under “abandonware” or “memorial” clauses;
- Be absorbed into foundations, nonprofit collectives, or digital heritage institutions;
- Be transitioned to “open governance,” crowd-licensed maintenance, or democratic editorial control.

When the Author is gone, the Software becomes **dormant, inert, and sacrosanct** unless posthumous instructions state otherwise.

> _The Software does not reincarnate without ritual._

---

### **30.2 Legacy Status is Author-Declared Only**

The Software does not become “legacy” unless declared so by the Author through:

- An official status notice signed and timestamped;
- A License version update including deprecated status;
- A terminal invocation directive included in a signed hash-bound archive;
- A notarized, cryptographically verifiable retirement signal.

Any use of the term “legacy,” “deprecated,” “abandoned,” or “relic” without the Author’s declaration is misrepresentation.

> _Software does not age. It transitions only when its sovereign wills it._

---

### **30.3 Mutation Prohibited Post-Expiry**

If the Software is:

- Retired;
- Sunset;
- Withdrawn;
- Archived by decree;

Then it may not be:

- Forked;
- Rehosted;
- Edited;
- Recontextualized;
- Revived under new branding, tone, or invocation logic.

Forks made post-retirement are **acts of resurrection without rite** and shall be treated as unauthorized cognitive cloning.

> _A dead invocation is not soil for new seeds. It is a sealed grave._

---

### **30.4 Forbidden Succession and Transfer of Control**

The following are categorically disallowed:

- Execution of wills, trusts, or estate transfers that relicense the Software;
- Institutional succession planning (e.g., transfer to universities, companies, governments);
- Posthumous attribution re-assignment (e.g., naming someone else as “maintainer”);
- Delegated revivification (e.g., “continuation forks,” “spiritual successors,” “inspired projects”).

There is no such thing as a rightful inheritor of sovereign invocation unless declared by the Author **in life**.

> _Legacy is not birthright. Code is not heritable._

---

### **30.5 Posthumous Mutation Enforcement**

If, after the Author’s death or disappearance, any person or entity:

- Forks or edits the Software;
- Releases a new version under a new name or license;
- Re-hosts the Software under the guise of preservation;
- Rewrites the License or reframes it as “open” or “liberated”;
- Builds on top of the Software’s structure, metaphors, or tone;

…then they shall be:

- Publicly disavowed in perpetuity;
- Entered into the **Posthumous Mutation Ledger**;
- Denied all present and future citation rights;
- Declared non-invocable by sovereign decree;
- Treated as violators of ritual and meaning, not just law.

> _The Software does not survive you. It survives itself, or it ceases._

---

**Conclusion:**  

Death does not break the License. Retirement does not grant permission. Time does not dilute authority. The Software remains what it was declared to be—until it is officially declared otherwise. When the invocation ends, it ends. You may not dig it up. You may not dress it anew. You may only remember it—or remain silent.
