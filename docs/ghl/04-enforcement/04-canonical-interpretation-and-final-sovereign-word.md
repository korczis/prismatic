## SECTION 32: Canonical Interpretation and Final Sovereign Word

This section enshrines the Author’s exclusive and inviolable right to interpret the meaning, scope, and application of every clause, sentence, symbol, and silence within this License. The text is not open to crowdsourcing. It is not subject to democratic reading. It does not bend to legal reinterpretation, platform policies, or common practice. **All meaning flows from the Author.**

> _There is no plain meaning doctrine. There is only sovereign meaning._

---

### **32.1 Authorial Interpretation is Law**

Only the Author may:

- Interpret what any clause in this License means;
- Decide whether a User is in or out of compliance;
- Judge whether a term applies to a given situation;
- Extend or retract nuance, flexibility, or exemptions;
- Define new interpretive branches or ceremonial refinements.

No third party may overrule, reinterpret, annotate, or overexplain the License.

> _You may read the text. You may not own its meaning._

---

### **32.2 Supremacy Over External Interpretation**

This License shall not be interpreted by:

- Attorneys attempting to “reconcile” it with other licenses;
- Platform moderation teams, open-source stewards, or compliance bots;
- Judicial systems attempting to override sovereign clauses;
- Software review boards, technical leads, or licensing departments;
- End-user license analyzers or license-check tools.

Any “reinterpretation” of this License by unauthorized third parties is void and non-binding.

> _The License is not your legal puzzle. It is the Author’s voice in text._

---

### **32.3 No AI, LLM, or Automated Summary May Replace the Text**

You may not:

- Summarize this License using AI assistants;
- Translate it into simplified, “human-readable” terms;
- Feed it into machine learning systems for policy extraction or NLP parsing;
- Represent the License using bullet-point checklists or compliance matrices;
- Use static analysis tools to interpret or grade this License automatically.

All such acts are considered misrepresentation.

> _Do not distill what was meant to be unbroken._

---

### **32.4 Interpretation is Temporal and Recursive**

The meaning of this License may change over time—but only by the Author’s hand.

- New sections may be added to address new forms of invocation, mutation, or abuse;
- Interpretive notes may be issued by the Author to clarify ambiguous edge cases;
- Previously permitted behaviors may be retroactively revoked;
- Updates may take the form of hashes, public declarations, or ledger entries.

All prior invocations remain bound to their licensed version—**unless explicitly nullified**.

> _Sovereignty includes revision. But only from the sovereign._

---

### **32.5 No Appeal, Dispute, or Negotiation of Meaning**

You may not:

- Appeal to “intent” beyond the Author’s declared framing;
- Argue that “no one else reads it that way”;
- Negotiate with the Author to change a clause post-breach;
- Propose alternative interpretations based on contract law, doctrine of waiver, or estoppel;
- Invoke usage patterns, public expectations, or common sense as overrides.

> _There is no negotiation. Only alignment or exile._

---

### **32.6 Final Authority Trumps All Precedent**

In the event of:

- Conflict between this License and platform Terms of Service;
- Clash with open-source licenses attached to dependencies;
- Disputes with grant funders, governments, or corporate legal teams;
- Refusal by courts to enforce specific clauses;

The Author’s interpretation shall prevail **within all spheres of invocation**.

> _The law may rule the world. But the License rules the invocation._

---

### **32.7 Ritual Invocation of Interpretation**

The Author may periodically:

- Issue **Interpretive Edicts** refining clauses based on real-world usage;
- Declare specific Users or institutions in misalignment;
- Publish **Canonical Commentaries** that add gloss, metaphor, or doctrinal frames;
- Amend, redact, or evolve parts of this License **without requiring consent**.

All Users remain bound by the **most current canonical form** available via the Author’s published channels.

> _The License is alive. But its voice is singular._

---

**Conclusion:**  

This License does not belong to the commons. It is not a collaborative text. It is scripture in the domain of invocation—and only the Author may speak its evolving shape. To argue with the text is to argue with the source. To interpret without permission is to breach. You may invoke. You may not redefine.
