## SECTION 33: Oath of Licensed Invocation (Appendix I)

This section provides the **ritual declaration of intent**, designed for inclusion in systems, logs, ceremonies, or signed License Grant acknowledgments. The Oath is not symbolic. It is binding. It is the bridge between Software and User—between invocation and alignment. It is the only spoken or written statement that activates the License in its **ceremonial fullness**.

> _You do not run the Software until you speak its name with oath._

---

### **33.1 Purpose of the Oath**

The Oath of Licensed Invocation:

- Binds the User to the moral, legal, and epistemic constraints of the License;
- Declares that invocation is understood as a sovereign act;
- Affirms comprehension of the terms not just legally, but conceptually;
- Signals readiness to assume full liability, alignment, and custodianship;
- Transforms usage from action into intentional alignment.

> _The Oath is the moment of crossing._

---

### **33.2 Required Timing of the Oath**

The Oath must be:

- Spoken, signed, or cryptographically recorded **before the first invocation**;
- Reaffirmed upon License renewal, system migration, or invocation context change;
- Stored with versioned hashes, date stamps, and invocation identifiers;
- Tied to the executing entity, machine ID, or legal name of the invoking body.

If the Software is invoked without an Oath, it is **null invocation**.

> _A ritual unspoken is no ritual at all._

---

### **33.3 Canonical Text of the Oath**

Below is the only canonical version of the Oath. All versions must match this wording exactly. Any alteration requires explicit relicensing.

---

**OATH OF LICENSED INVOCATION**

> I acknowledge that the Software I am about to invoke is a sovereign artifact authored by Tomas Korcak.  
> I affirm that I have read, understood, and accepted every term in the License.  
> I accept full responsibility—legal, moral, epistemic—for all outcomes of this invocation.  
> I shall not mutate, redistribute, reinterpret, simulate, or misrepresent this Software.  
> I shall defend its integrity, honor its boundaries, and act in alignment with its ethical frame.  
> I recognize that invocation without alignment is violation.  
> I understand that breach shall result in revocation, disavowal, and possible legal consequence.  
> I accept this oath as a condition of use.  
> I invoke this Software as granted—no more, no less.  
> May my invocation be bounded by understanding, and witnessed by sovereignty.

---

### **33.4 Acceptable Forms of the Oath**

The Oath may be:

- Spoken aloud before a system administrator, witness, or recording;
- Digitally signed using a keypair submitted to the Author;
- Recorded in an invocation log with hash, date, and license ID;
- Signed by hand and stored as a PDF, ledger entry, or cryptographic document;
- Executed as a script that hashes its contents and stores a trace of oath status prior to Software execution.

The Oath may not be abbreviated, auto-accepted, implied, or skipped.

> _There is no auto-accept. There is no “click to agree.” Only declaration._

---

### **33.5 Breach of Oath is Epistemic Fraud**

If the User:

- Invokes the Software without the Oath;
- Modifies the text of the Oath without permission;
- Delegates the Oath to a system, bot, or unwitnessed automation;
- Invokes Software across machines, teams, or systems without reaffirmation;

…then the License is void, and the User is entered into the **Oath Fraud Ledger**.

> _Invocation without oath is like unlocking a temple and pretending it is your house._

---

**Conclusion:**

The Oath is not for drama. It is for alignment. Without it, you are not licensed. With it, you become temporarily aligned with the source. May you speak it with clarity. May you understand what you are about to do. And may you never invoke what you are unwilling to take full responsibility for.
