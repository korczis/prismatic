## SECTION 27: Time, Recursion, and Temporal Re-entry

This section governs the temporal parameters of invocation. It affirms that the Software is not timeless, eternal, or boundless across moments. It is designed to be invoked **in time**, **with intent**, and **within the Author’s defined rhythm**. Recursion, repetition, and time-traveling invocation—literal or metaphorical—are forbidden unless specifically licensed.

> _You do not loop the sacred. You do not schedule the sovereign._

---

### **27.1 Invocation is Moment-Specific**

Every invocation of the Software must be:

- Performed **deliberately** by a licensed entity;
- Bound to a specific moment of execution, not abstracted into schedules or future guesses;
- Recorded with timestamp fidelity (if required by the Grant);
- Not executed based on cron jobs, automation scripts, or asynchronous orchestration;
- Not replicated across time via time-traveling agents, delayed invocations, or cloned job graphs.

Invocation is not “running code.” It is **temporal entry** into the Author’s frame.

> _Every execution is a ritual. You may not automate your rituals._

---

### **27.2 Forbidden Forms of Recursion**

The Software may not be:

- Called by itself directly or indirectly;
- Used to generate, transform, or supervise additional invocations of itself;
- Wrapped in recursive logic, feedback loops, or controller trees;
- Embedded in compilers, transpilers, or code generation tools that regenerate its own form;
- Trained into models that learn from its outputs and reinvoke it for iterative refinement.

> _You may not nest the invocation. Sovereignty does not echo._

---

### **27.3 Disallowed Time-Based Invocation Triggers**

The Software may not be:

- Scheduled by time-based systems (e.g., cron, systemd timers, cloud schedulers);
- Tied to calendar events, daylight cycles, or workflow queues;
- Set to auto-run during idle, startup, or nightly batch cycles;
- Triggered by timers or expiry conditions without manual confirmation;
- Looped through until failure, success, or convergence.

Invocation must be **now**, by human will, unless licensed otherwise.

> _You may not put the Software on a clock. You must meet it in the present._

---

### **27.4 No Archival Re-entry or Historical Replay**

The Software may not be:

- Re-run on historical data sets to reconstruct past behavior;
- Used to replay invocation sequences from logs, archives, or backups;
- Deployed in systems that simulate, rerun, or “fast-forward” invocation environments;
- Referenced in forensic environments for reconstruction of prior system states;
- Used to generate alternate histories, outcomes, or predictions.

You may not use the Software to bend time.

> _It runs once, and only once, in the now. Invocation is not simulation._

---

### **27.5 Temporal Scaling and Invocation Overload**

Unless licensed, the Software may not be:

- Invoked at scale beyond the rate or concurrency defined in the License Grant;
- Parallelized across multiple CPUs, clusters, or regions for throughput optimization;
- Time-sliced, forked, or reduced into atomic intervals for fractional invocation;
- Invoked simultaneously across geographic time zones or global failover pairs.

> _There is one invocation per now. All others are echoes—and they are forbidden._

---

### **27.6 Time-Aware Invocation Contracts**

The Author may impose time-specific constraints such as:

- Invocable hours (e.g., no invocation during specific global windows);
- Expiry dates for binary execution or license validation;
- Runtime self-destruct clauses after N seconds of execution;
- Maximum allowable uptime or idle duration before forced shutdown.

The Software is not eternally awake. It lives when called and sleeps when uninvoked.

> _Invocation is a pulse—not a process._

---

### **27.7 Enforcement of Temporal Breach**

If the Software is found to be:

- Running without recent authorization;
- Looping recursively without pause;
- Auto-triggered by system time, timer, or cron artifact;
- Forked and run in historical emulation or test net mirrors;

The Author may:

- Issue a **Temporal Violation Writ**;
- Add the entity to the **Recursive Breach Registry**;
- Publish an **Invocation Drift Notice** nullifying all outputs since the breach timestamp;
- Trigger license revocation and public warning about time-violating systems.

> _Time is sacred. The Software must not be dragged across it like cloth._

---

**Conclusion:**  

The Software exists in time—bounded, sovereign, and momentary. You may not loop it, schedule it, or invoke it across eras. You may only meet it, once, in each now. That is your right. That is your limit.
