## Key Technical Principles

- **Structural Integrity**: Software must remain unmodified and uncomposed
- **Bounded Execution**: All execution must occur within explicitly defined boundaries
- **Human Oversight**: No autonomous invocation without conscious human custodianship
- **Epistemic Protection**: Prevention of meaning dilution through technical misuse
- **Ceremonial Computing**: Technical usage must align with ritual and philosophical frameworks

- **Next**: [Enforcement](../04-enforcement/)
