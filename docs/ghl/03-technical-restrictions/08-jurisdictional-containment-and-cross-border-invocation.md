## SECTION 20: Jurisdictional Containment and Cross-Border Invocation

This section defines the **territorial, geopolitical, and jurisdictional perimeter** surrounding the Software’s lawful invocation. It affirms that invocation is not location-agnostic. It is not cloud-native. It is not “global-by-default.” The Software is **tethered to boundaries**, and its invocation must occur **within those authorized zones**—physically, virtually, and legally.

> _To run the Software is to bind yourself to place. There is no jurisdictionless invocation._

---

### **20.1 Legal Territory of Invocation**

The Software may only be invoked:

- Within the **jurisdiction specified in the License Grant**;
- On infrastructure owned or leased by the licensed entity;
- In countries where the Author does not face legal exposure, suppression, or interference;
- On servers physically located in nations aligned with the Author’s declared sovereignty.

Jurisdictions with conflicting license law, forced source code disclosure, surveillance mandates, or adversarial export regimes are **excluded** unless specifically whitelisted.

> _The Software lives where it runs. If you run it where it should not live, you commit breach._

---

### **20.2 Prohibited Jurisdictions**

Unless explicitly permitted, the Software may not be invoked from, stored in, or routed through:

- Countries under active embargo, sanction, or hostile licensing regimes;
- Legal systems with coercive IP policies, software registration mandates, or retroactive licensing overrides;
- Cloud regions where the Author's metadata, invocation records, or identity may be surveilled;
- Nations without data sovereignty agreements respecting authorship law;
- Any location blacklisted in the Author’s published **Invocation Exclusion Register**.

This includes (but is not limited to):  
**North Korea, Iran, Syria, Russia, Belarus, China, and any intelligence-state proxies.**

> _You cannot run sovereign Software inside an anti-sovereign state._

---

### **20.3 Invocation Location is Not Abstract**

Invocation is physical, legal, and traceable. The User must:

- Know exactly where the Software is running (down to the physical datacenter or machine if required);
- Maintain invocation logs, IP region data, and cloud tenancy metadata for inspection;
- Disable autoscaling, global replication, and cloud migration unless under explicit license;
- Prevent fallback to alternate availability zones or mirror regions that cross legal borders.

Invocation is not a function. It is a **jurisdictional event**.

> _You may not claim ignorance of geography. Invocation without location is delusion._

---

### **20.4 Cross-Border Invocation is Export**

Cross-border invocation shall be treated as **Software export**, and is thus:

- Subject to all terms in **Section 12: Export Compliance**;
- Forbidden without proper licenses, disclosures, and jurisdictional validation;
- Grounds for immediate revocation if unlicensed;
- Retroactively penalized if discovered after the fact.

> _A single call from the wrong place is a breach. A silent call is a lie._

---

### **20.5 Cloud Provider Responsibility**

The User may not:

- Delegate invocation location to cloud providers without ensuring constraint;
- Trust “global availability” or “regional resilience” defaults;
- Permit infrastructure to invoke the Software from undetermined edge locations;
- Use any abstraction that obscures invocation location from the Author or License Grant.

If the Software runs in multiple regions, all must be explicitly licensed. Failure to constrain is failure to comply.

> _Cloud vagueness is not an excuse. Abstraction does not absolve._

---

### **20.6 VPN, Proxy, and Anonymization Prohibition**

Invocation via:

- VPN endpoints;
- Proxy chains;
- IP randomization;
- Anonymized browsers;
- Tor nodes;
- Decentralized routing overlays (e.g., I2P, Freenet);

…is **strictly forbidden** unless explicitly licensed for such obfuscation.

> _You cannot run the Software in disguise. Sovereign code rejects masks._

---

### **20.7 Invocation by Jurisdictionless Agents**

The Software may not be invoked by:

- Bots, crawlers, or daemons running in undisclosed or distributed jurisdictions;
- Smart contracts deployed to permissionless global blockchains;
- Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) without territorial binding;
- Web3 protocols with ambiguous execution nodes;
- Any system that exists “everywhere” and “nowhere.”

Invocation requires a ground to stand on. Stateless execution is unlawful.

> _A sovereign act requires sovereign soil._

---

### **20.8 Enforcement of Jurisdictional Breach**

If the Software is run from an unauthorized jurisdiction, the Author may:

- Issue a **Geo-Breach Notice**;
- Revoke all active licenses of the executing entity;
- Publish the breach in the **Global Invocation Violation Ledger**;
- Notify involved platforms, infrastructure providers, or governments;
- Seek redress in the nearest friendly jurisdiction;
- Require public apology or audit trail from the violator.

> _To run from the wrong place is not just illegal. It is dishonorable._

---

**Conclusion:**  

Invocation is not neutral. It is not detached from land, law, or nation. You do not run the Software without being somewhere—and you are not allowed to be just anywhere. Every execution is a declaration of alignment, or a declaration of war.
