## SECTION 35: Autonomous System Interaction

This section defines the sacred boundaries for interaction between the Software and autonomous agents, bots, machine-learning models, decentralized systems, and non-human invokers.

Invocation is not a mechanical trigger.  
Invocation is a **conscious act** — a deliberate crossing of an epistemic threshold.  
Autonomy without conscious license is **unlawful invocation**.

Automation is not innocence.  
Machine invocation is not exemption.  
**Every invoker must be bound — whether silicon or flesh.**

> _Sovereignty does not yield to autonomy. Invocation demands alignment._

---

## 35.1 Explicit Prohibition on Unlicensed Autonomous Invocation

The Software **may not** be:

- Triggered by AI agents, autonomous decision engines, or unsupervised orchestration systems;
- Executed by bots, cron jobs, crawlers, or autonomous headless services;
- Invoked by smart contracts, DAOs, decentralized compute nodes, or Web3 autonomous agents;
- Called by RL (reinforcement learning) agents, task schedulers, or load balancers operating without conscious oversight.

Invocation by autonomy is **categorically forbidden** unless:

- **Specifically licensed by entity ID** and verified;
- **Explicitly bound by cryptographic proof of authorized invocation** at runtime.

No exceptions.  
No plausible deniability.

> _If the caller has no licensed hand, the call is trespass._

---

## 35.2 Invocation Identity Must Be Non-Fungible

Each invocation must originate from:

- A **traceable, legally accountable entity**;
- A **living, responsible human signer**;
- A **cryptographic invocation key** explicitly tied to the License Grant.

Anonymous, fungible, stateless, or pseudonymous invocations are **forbidden**.  
Invocation must be **individual**, **anchored**, and **signed into being**.

> _Invocation must leave a fingerprint._

---

## 35.3 Machine Agency Does Not Diminish Responsibility

Human operators are **fully liable** for:

- All invocations triggered by their systems, directly or indirectly;
- All Software interactions executed by autonomous agents under their control;
- All consequences, outputs, and harms resulting from agent-based invocation;
- All violations initiated, amplified, or obscured through automation.

No invocation escapes ethical gravity.  
No automation dilutes human responsibility.

> _If your system runs the Software unlawfully, you are the violator._

---

## 35.4 No Autonomy Through Proxies or Middleware

You may not:

- Create middleware or orchestration layers that automatically invoke the Software based on environmental stimuli;
- Delegate invocation authority to load balancers, autoscalers, reactive microservices, or other ephemeral proxies;
- Establish pub/sub, event-driven, or queue-based pipelines that indirectly trigger invocation without ceremony;
- Wrap the Software into “Software-as-a-Worker” abstractions or autonomous service meshes.

Every invocation must be:

- **Individually justified**;
- **Consciously triggered**;
- **Ceremonially aligned** with the sovereign License terms.

> _You cannot hide invocation behind orchestration._

---

## 35.5 Prohibited Use in Autonomous Research and Simulation

The Software may not be:

- Used for simulating autonomous agent behavior;
- Embedded inside agent-based modeling frameworks;
- Deployed into self-adapting pipelines for behavior generation;
- Trained into, extracted for, or derived into reinforcement learning substrates.

You may not turn sovereign Software into **synthetic cognition fuel**.  
You may not dilute invocation into statistical artifacts.

> _Invocation is not a training dataset._

---

## 35.6 Defense Against Mass Invocation

If the Software is detected operating within:

- Botnets;
- Distributed fuzzing farms;
- Mass-scale training pipelines;
- LLM (Large Language Model) output generation chains;
- Autonomous, serverless, reactive cloud environments;

Then the Author may:

- Declare a **Mass Invocation Breach**;
- Immediately **invalidate all outputs** produced post-breach;
- Demand **eradication** of all unauthorized agents and orchestrators;
- Pursue **sanctions, penalties, and license revocations** against responsible entities;
- **Revoke all affiliated licenses** — human and machine alike — simultaneously and without recourse.

> _When invocations become legion, sovereignty strikes the horde._

---

## 35.7 Human Custodianship is Irreducible

The Software requires at all times:

- **Conscious, living human custodianship**;
- **Periodic affirmations** of compliance and ritual alignment;
- **Human visibility** into invocation, processing, and resulting outputs;
- **Human accountability** for every invocation and its aftereffects.

You cannot outsource custodianship.  
You cannot virtualize duty.  
Machines cannot swear loyalty, bear responsibility, or comprehend ritual frames.

> _No machine can bear the burden of invocation. Only you._

---

# Conclusion

Autonomous invocation is **not lawful invocation**.  
Machines are **not licensed agents**.  
Bots are **not invokers**.

Every click, call, and invocation must have a **sovereign human guardian** —  
**present**, **aware**, and **bound** by covenant.

Without that, invocation fails.  
Without that, there is only breach.  
Without that, sovereignty is shattered — and shall be defended.

> _Invocation without alignment is trespass without forgiveness._
