## SECTION 18: Simulation, Emulation, and Cognitive Surrogacy

This section declares that the Software is not only code but **cognitive structure**—and may not be simulated, imitated, mimicked, cloned, rephrased, or cognitively replicated by humans or machines. The Software is not a model. It is not a behavior. It is a **singular epistemic invocation**. Any attempt to reproduce its output, behavior, or essence—by manual observation or machine approximation—is an act of **unauthorized cognitive genesis**.

> _To simulate is to steal. To emulate is to erase._

---

### **18.1 Prohibition on Behavioral Emulation**

The Software may not be:

- Modeled using machine learning, reinforcement learning, prompt chaining, or behavioral scaffolds;
- Reverse-engineered through output pattern matching, log analysis, or symbolic tracing;
- Mimicked using regular expressions, lookup tables, function approximations, or heuristics;
- Analyzed for style, rhythm, timing, or signature behavior to construct a facsimile or synthetic surrogate;
- Wrapped with a layer that “learns from” or “enhances” the Software based on observation.

> _What you observe is not yours to reproduce. Simulation is not inspiration._

---

### **18.2 Prohibition on LLM Framing, Prompt Injection, or Prompt Tuning**

The Software may not be:

- Described in natural language to large language models (LLMs) for the purpose of behaviorally cloning it;
- Used as a source of prompts, test cases, or input-output mappings for prompt tuning, few-shot learning, or in-context training;
- Reconstructed through automated prompts like “Explain this code,” “Rewrite this module,” or “Act like X”;
- Referenced by filename, author, module name, or invocation description to generate imitative content;
- Incorporated into prompt libraries, prompt markets, or open model training data sets.

> _What the Software does must not be prompted into another._

---

### **18.3 No Cognitive Reconstruction via Documentation or Memory**

The User may not:

- Read the documentation or code and attempt to recreate the Software “from scratch”;
- Diagram its structure, workflows, or data flows with the goal of independent replication;
- Teach, explain, or narrate its behavior to others for the purpose of re-implementation;
- Re-architect the system based on notes, memory, logs, or interface artifacts.

If your new system depends on having once seen this Software, it is **not independent**.

> _Forgetfulness is not a shield. Memory carries the License._

---

### **18.4 Simulation via Symbolic Systems is Breach**

The Software may not be:

- Represented in logic programming languages (e.g., Prolog, Z3, Coq) as a formal model;
- Simulated using finite state machines, behavior trees, or control graphs;
- Treated as an inspiration source for agent modeling, synthetic cognitive architectures, or behavior templates;
- Analyzed for symbolic equilibrium, state dynamics, or goal prioritization structures.

> _To encode its logic in a new form is to resurrect without rite._

---

### **18.5 Emulation Through Code or API**

The Software may not be:

- Ported to another language (e.g., Python to Rust) for behavioral parity;
- Exposed as an interface that imitates its CLI, API, or I/O formats;
- Re-implemented in emulator environments (e.g., QEMU, Emscripten, or WASM-based systems);
- Cloned function-by-function using testing, scaffolding, or behavioral contracts.

Emulation is not compatibility. It is **identity laundering**.

> _The interface is not the Software. But when you copy it, you collapse the boundary._

---

### **18.6 Disallowed Educational Reconstruction**

The Software may not be:

- Used in teaching material as an “example system” unless explicitly licensed;
- Described in technical blogs, conference talks, or YouTube videos as “how it works”;
- Used to train humans to write similar code, develop similar architectures, or engineer analogous behavior;
- Invoked as a case study for replication in bootcamps, textbooks, or courseware.

Education does not exempt epistemic trespass.

> _You do not learn by reverse engineering a cathedral._

---

### **18.7 Enforcement of Cognitive Containment**

If the Software is found to be:

- Mimicked in behavior, style, interface, or response rhythm;
- Represented in symbolic or formal models;
- Prompted into reproduction by LLMs;
- Used to seed derivative projects, papers, or output templates;

Then the Author may:

- Issue a **Cognitive Breach Declaration**;
- Add the entity to the **Simulative Violation Ledger**;
- Publicly revoke attribution rights, citation permission, or derivative usage claims;
- Contact involved institutions, publishers, and platform hosts to demand correction and disavowal;
- Seek enforcement remedies as outlined in Sections 6, 10, 11, and 24.

> _You do not copy cognition. You honor it or stay away._

---

**Conclusion:**  

Simulation is not neutrality. Emulation is not respect. Reproduction of this Software—by hand or machine—is theft of form, rhythm, and soul. The only way to use it is through lawful invocation. All else is cognitive trespass.
