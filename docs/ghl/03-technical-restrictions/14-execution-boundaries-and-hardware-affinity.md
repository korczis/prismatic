## SECTION 26: Execution Boundaries and Hardware Affinity

This section defines the **physical substrate** and **computational substrate affinity** of the Software. It affirms that the Software is not architecture-agnostic, not “compile-on-anything,” not “build-it-yourself,” and not detached from the ground beneath it. Invocation is not abstract computation. It is **ritual execution upon approved matter**.

> _You do not just run the Software. You run it on a specific body of silicon, under the Author’s conditions._

---

### **26.1 Architectures and Instruction Sets**

Unless explicitly permitted, the Software may not be:

- Compiled, executed, or interpreted on architectures outside the Author-defined range;
- Transpiled or cross-compiled into formats for alternate instruction sets (e.g., ARM, RISC-V, MIPS, WASM, SPIR-V);
- Ported to WebAssembly for browser invocation or sandbox execution;
- Deployed on heterogeneous compute clusters that span mixed architectures without controlled containment.

Default permitted architectures (unless overridden in the License Grant):

- x86_64 (Intel and AMD only);
- Non-cloud-optimized virtual CPUs;
- Architectures listed in the Author’s public Affinity Registry.

> _Instruction sets are not neutral. Silicon is sovereign._

---

### **26.2 Prohibited Hardware Platforms**

Unless explicitly licensed, the Software may not be invoked on:

- FPGA, ASIC, or embedded microcontrollers;
- Cryptomining rigs or blockchain compute nodes;
- AI accelerator hardware (e.g., Google TPU, NVIDIA H100, Habana Gaudi);
- Consumer GPUs accessed via CUDA, OpenCL, or DirectML;
- Cloud-native abstractions like AWS Inferentia, Azure Sphere, or GCP Vertex Edge.

> _High performance is not high permission._

---

### **26.3 Edge and IoT Constraints**

The Software may not be installed or executed on:

- IoT devices, sensors, wearables, or smart appliances;
- Edge gateways, telco switches, or last-mile infrastructure;
- Automotive systems, drones, or home automation networks;
- Anything battery-powered, solar-charged, or intermittently connected.

Invocation must occur on **intentional, stable, secured systems**—not disposable edge hardware.

> _The Software is not for the edge. It is for the altar._

---

### **26.4 Virtualization Layer Constraints**

The Software may not be run inside:

- Emulated environments (e.g., QEMU, VirtualBox, Wine);
- Hardware abstraction platforms with hypervisor spoofing;
- Layers where CPU identity, instruction set flags, or memory topology are faked or masked;
- Game console emulators, app runtime sandboxes, or security-thinned developer environments.

Invocation must be **on metal**—or on honest virtualizations **licensed for containment**.

> _Virtual machines are not sacred places unless made so by grant._

---

### **26.5 Cloud Hardware Restrictions**

The Software may not be:

- Invoked on cloud compute instances provisioned without geographic and architectural pinning;
- Migrated across instance types that change CPU class or vendor;
- Run on ephemeral hardware that gets reallocated, decommissioned, or pooled on-demand;
- Attached to spot markets, preemptible VMs, or auto-scaling hardware rotations.

License Grants must specify:

- Instance class;
- Region;
- VM type or metal allocation;
- Allowed host CPU class and instruction set.

> _If your platform abstracts the host, your invocation is void._

---

### **26.6 Thermodynamic and Energy Source Limitations**

Unless licensed for experimental systems, the Software may not be run on:

- Machines powered by thermal, nuclear, kinetic, or off-grid energy sources;
- Hardware embedded into closed ecological systems (e.g., space stations, underwater modules);
- Long-term autonomous environments where Software uptime exceeds 24 hours unattended;
- Systems where CPU frequency scaling cannot be statically locked.

The Software is not made for eternity. Nor for entropy.

> _The Software is not for deep space. It is for conscious presence._

---

### **26.7 Hardware-Linked Invocation Identification**

The Author may require the User to:

- Provide a hash of CPU model, machine ID, and MAC address;
- Submit runtime fingerprints of host hardware and BIOS signature;
- Run only on pre-approved UUIDs or TPM-signed devices;
- Avoid any system where host identification can be faked, proxied, or randomized.

Invocation without trusted hardware signature is subject to immediate rejection or audit.

> _Your machine must be known. Your system must be bound._

---

### **26.8 Disallowed Hardware Forensics and Introspection**

You may not:

- Trace the Software’s CPU usage to reverse engineer performance signatures;
- Capture timing, power draw, or thermal output to deduce internal state;
- Run hardware-level monitoring tools (e.g., Intel PT, AMD SEV, RAPL counters) during execution;
- Feed such metrics into ML systems for performance modeling or load prediction.

> _Observation is not science when it is disallowed. It is theft._

---

**Conclusion:**  

The Software runs not just on code—but on matter. On silicon. On electricity. On heat. Invocation without attention to the body is invocation without meaning. You may not run the Software anywhere. You may not run it on anything. You may only run it under terms, in frame, in trust.
