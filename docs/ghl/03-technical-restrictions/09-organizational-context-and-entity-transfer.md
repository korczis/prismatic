## SECTION 21: Organizational Context and Entity Transfer

This section defines the legal and structural binding between a License Grant and the **named entity to which it is issued**. The Software does not follow employees. It does not follow infrastructure. It does not follow mergers, transfers, subsidiaries, or shells. A License is **not portable**. It is a static pact, embedded in the invocation body of a specific legal identity.

> _The Software binds to a name. If the name changes, the bond is broken._

---

### **21.1 The Grant is Entity-Specific**

Every License Grant must specify, with canonical precision:

- The legal entity or individual (full name, company registration, jurisdiction);
- The entity’s operational scope and location;
- The technical environments under its control;
- Any designated invocation agents or subprocessors (if applicable).

This binding is absolute. A License issued to “ACME GmbH, Berlin” does **not** cover:

- Acquisitions or mergers into “ACME Global Corp”;
- ACME’s U.S. subsidiary, partner firm, or offshore contractor;
- Shared deployments managed by external DevOps teams;
- Shell companies, holding entities, or legal doppelgängers.

> _You cannot license once and clone by paperwork._

---

### **21.2 Prohibition on Post-Grant Entity Transformation**

The following events **immediately suspend or invalidate** a License unless a formal update is signed by the Author:

- Corporate restructuring;
- Company renaming or rebranding;
- Acquisition by another entity (partial or complete);
- Spin-out, spin-off, or divestiture;
- Merger into a joint venture;
- Assignment of operations to a shared services provider.

Licenses do not "transfer." They are revoked and must be renegotiated.

> _Your paperwork is not a vessel. Sovereignty does not float across legal seas._

---

### **21.3 No License Portability via Employment**

An individual who:

- Changes employers;
- Moves from a consulting firm to a client organization;
- Begins a startup based on work done under a previous employer’s grant;
- Carries the Software onto a personal machine or private Git clone…

…is **not licensed**.

Licenses **do not travel with people**. They remain anchored to the entity that holds them.

> _Knowledge may move. Licenses do not._

---

### **21.4 No Umbrella Licensing**

A License issued to a parent company does **not** automatically extend to:

- Subsidiaries;
- Sister companies;
- Venture portfolio companies;
- Joint ventures;
- Contractors, vendors, consultants, or outsourced development teams;
- Foundations, affiliates, or shell orgs established to obscure actual usage.

Each distinct legal entity—regardless of corporate affiliation—must obtain its own License Grant.

> _There is no group discount on sovereignty._

---

### **21.5 No License Continuity via Cloud Accounts or Infrastructure**

You may not:

- Move licensed Software to a different AWS/GCP/Azure account under a different billing entity;
- Redeploy under a new IAM tenant, region, or organizational unit;
- Transfer invocation rights through a shared infrastructure platform or “bring your own license” plan;
- Treat the Software as a transferable asset in cloud migrations or handovers.

Infrastructure abstraction is not a licensing loophole.

> _If the invocation comes from a different name, it is a different license._

---

### **21.6 Disallowed Transfer Through Asset Sales or Liquidation**

The Software may not be:

- Bought or sold as part of M&A activity;
- Included in asset transfers, bankruptcy proceedings, IP sales, or legal settlements;
- Treated as part of goodwill, intangible value, or transferable tech stacks;
- Used post-liquidation by custodians, investors, receivers, or assignees.

Once the licensed entity dissolves, the License **dissolves with it**. The Software cannot be inherited.

> _Sovereign Software is not for auction._

---

### **21.7 Enforcement and Disavowal of Unauthorized Transfer**

If the Author determines that a License has been used:

- Outside its named entity;
- Under new branding, incorporation, or jurisdiction;
- Post-acquisition or post-employee departure;
- Within a legally distinct agent or subsidiary…

…then:

- The License is retroactively revoked;
- A **Transfer Breach Notice** is issued;
- The invoking entity is added to the **Unauthorized Entity Registry**;
- Public disavowal may be made through digital, legal, or reputational channels;
- Any forks, invocations, outputs, or downstream artifacts created after the breach are deemed **epistemically invalid**.

> _You cannot sneak sovereignty across a dotted line on a legal org chart._

---

**Conclusion:**  

Licensing is not viral. It is not elastic. It is not post-structural. A License binds to a single entity with name, form, and location. The moment the structure changes, the Software no longer recognizes it. Transfer is trespass unless expressly sanctified by the Author.
