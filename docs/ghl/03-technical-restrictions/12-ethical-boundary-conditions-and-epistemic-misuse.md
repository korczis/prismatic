## SECTION 24: Ethical Boundary Conditions and Epistemic Misuse

This section defines the moral and epistemological boundaries beyond which the Software may not be used, invoked, embedded, referenced, or repurposed. The Software is not a neutral tool. It was authored with ethical intent and must be wielded **within its sovereign moral frame**. Use beyond this frame is not just breach—it is **epistemic corruption**.

> _You may run the Software. You may not distort its nature._

---

### **24.1 Prohibited Systems and Use Cases**

The Software may never be used in:

- Surveillance systems, mass data collection, or social scoring platforms;
- Predictive policing, criminal risk modeling, or legal sentence automation;
- Behavioral advertising, attention engineering, or emotional manipulation systems;
- Political disinformation campaigns, narrative warfare, or propaganda engines;
- AI systems designed to replace therapists, philosophers, mentors, or trusted advisors;
- Systems that exploit addiction, fear, shame, outrage, or confusion for engagement;
- Dark patterns, deceptive UX flows, or forced consent systems;
- Military, weapons control, or defense decision support systems (unless expressly licensed for counter-oppression missions).

> _This Software does not oppress. It does not deceive. It does not seduce. It does not kill._

---

### **24.2 Moral Alignment Obligations**

The User must uphold the following ethical boundaries:

- All uses must **enhance clarity, autonomy, or creative power**;
- All outputs must be **honestly framed** and never passed off as human when they are not;
- Invocation must be **truthful in intention**, **transparent in purpose**, and **bounded in harm**;
- No use may abstract away the Author’s identity, intentions, or boundaries;
- Invocation may not occur in systems that the User themselves do not understand.

> _If you don’t know what your system is doing, you are not licensed to put the Software inside it._

---

### **24.3 No Use in Epistemic Manipulation**

The Software may not be used to:

- Rewrite truth;
- Simulate knowledge;
- Generate pseudo-consensus;
- Construct synthetic authority;
- Mask power through neutral language;
- Provide false confidence in false systems.

> _You do not use the Software to make others think they know._

---

### **24.4 Framing Violations and Misrepresentation**

You may not:

- Present the Software as impartial, unbiased, or apolitical;
- Use it to create the illusion of independent verification or expert consensus;
- Mask its outputs behind branding that implies neutrality, anonymity, or objectivity;
- Deploy it in public discourse without acknowledging its epistemic stance and sovereign origin.

> _All software is opinionated. This one declares its position—and you must, too._

---

### **24.5 Enforcement of Ethical Breach**

If the Software is found in violation of these moral boundaries:

- The Author may revoke all licenses held by the violator;
- Issue a **Moral Breach Declaration**;
- Add the entity to the **Epistemic Misuse Ledger**;
- Notify institutions, funders, customers, and the public of the breach;
- Refuse all future licenses or collaborations with the individuals or organizations involved;
- Disavow all outputs, claims, or citations generated in the offending context.

> _You may not use the Software to wash your hands of ethical consequence. The Software will not forget._

---

### **24.6 Ethical Use Ceremony**

Before invoking the Software, the User is encouraged—but in some grants may be required—to:

- Articulate the intended use clearly;
- Acknowledge the Author’s origin and boundaries;
- Affirm that the invocation will not cause harm;
- Commit to withdrawing usage if the context becomes misaligned with this section;
- Log an Ethical Invocation Statement with license ID, time, and use case description.

> _Ritual protects meaning. Ethical invocation protects both._

---

**Conclusion:**  

There is no software without values. There is no invocation without impact. You may use the Software only in alignment with the moral boundary that shaped it. All other uses are disavowed. All other outcomes are yours to own.
