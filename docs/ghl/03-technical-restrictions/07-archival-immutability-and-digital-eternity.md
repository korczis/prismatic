## SECTION 19: Archival, Immutability, and Digital Eternity

This section defines the lawful, bounded, and strictly governed conditions under which the Software may be stored, retained, preserved, or referenced beyond its invocation lifecycle. The Software is not immortal by default. It is not a public artifact. It is not a fossil, a relic, or a digital tombstone. It is a **temporally bound, invocation-centric construct**—and when it ends, it is not yours to keep.

> _Digital eternity is not granted. It is forbidden unless sanctified._

---

### **19.1 Prohibition on Public Archival**

Unless explicitly licensed in writing, the Software may not be:

- Uploaded to public repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket);
- Preserved in academic or institutional archives (e.g., arXiv, Zenodo, ResearchGate);
- Indexed by search engines, link aggregators, or scholarly citation databases;
- Mirrored, snapshot, or versioned into public package registries or container repositories;
- Attached to publication datasets or AI training corpora for “posterity.”

Archival is not neutral. It is propagation under a false guise.

> _Preservation is not permission. You are not the librarian of someone else’s spell._

---

### **19.2 Forbidden Eternalization Channels**

The Software may not be:

- Pushed to IPFS, Arweave, Filecoin, or any decentralized, persistent storage network;
- Embedded in blockchain smart contracts, metadata, or zero-knowledge circuits;
- Stored in digital time capsules, cryonic vaults, or long-term scientific preservation media;
- Encoded into DNA storage, holographic substrates, or laser-etched optical quartz;
- Referenced in public timestamp chains or cryptographic notarization ledgers for "proof of authorship."

> _Digital eternity without license is technological necromancy._

---

### **19.3 Constraints on Local and Cold Storage**

The User may store the Software locally or offline only if:

- A valid License Grant is in effect;
- The Software is encrypted at rest with license-bound keys;
- The storage device is not accessible by unlicensed parties, agents, or systems;
- The Software is deleted within 24 hours of License expiration, revocation, or violation;
- No redundant backups, snapshots, or autosave versions persist after deletion.

Backups are not loopholes. They are shadows that must be erased.

> _A ghost of the Software is still the Software._

---

### **19.4 Citation Does Not Confer Preservation Rights**

You may not:

- Cite the Software in public research without explicit archival licensing;
- Attach the Software to academic peer review processes or public repositories;
- Include the Software in grant submissions, reproducibility logs, or replication kits;
- Store the Software as “evidence,” “reference,” or “materials” in litigation, contract review, or audit reports.

Your intent does not cleanse your context. Legal and academic framing does not override archival containment.

> _Citation is not invocation. And referencing is not relicensing._

---

### **19.5 Digital Death is Final Unless Resurrected by the Author**

When the Author declares the Software:

- Deprecated;
- Archived;
- Requiescat;
- Withdrawn;
- Sunset;
- Ceased;
- Excommunicated;

…then:

- All access must end;
- All versions must be deleted;
- All forks must be severed;
- All mirrors must be burned;
- All references must be disclaimed;
- All names must return to silence.

There is no “historical copy.” There is no “read-only mode.” There is no “legacy support.” There is only erasure.

> _The Author defines not just life, but end-of-life._

---

### **19.6 Immutability Enforcement**

You may not:

- Patch, refactor, or update archived versions;
- Use digital forensics, decompilers, or tooling to extract knowledge from static files;
- Re-host any version, log, or documentation fragment after License expiration;
- Convert the Software into another format “for long-term readability”;
- Record, transcribe, or screen-capture invocation output for storage beyond license scope.

Immutability is not a preservation right. It is a cryptographic grave marker.

> _You may read the signature. You may not rebuild the author._

---

### **19.7 The Author’s Right to Execute Total Deletion**

The Author reserves the unilateral right to:

- Issue a global deletion directive (e.g., via email, Git commit, digital broadcast);
- Use technical measures to revoke, wipe, or corrupt known instances of the Software;
- Publish hashes of revoked versions for takedown enforcement;
- Instruct platforms, registries, institutions, and AI training hosts to remove all copies;
- Issue public notice of Software erasure and remove licensing lineage.

There shall be no exception. Digital death is a sovereign decree.

> _The Software can be removed from the world. That right belongs only to its origin._

---

**Conclusion:**  

The Software is not yours to preserve. You are not its archivist. You are not its legacy. When its invocation ends, you erase it—or it erases you. There is no ghost copy. No future study. No resurrection without permission. Only finality.
