## SECTION 25: Attribution, Visibility, and Branding Control

This section governs the conditions under which the Software’s name, identity, origin, authorship, and visual or symbolic representation may be revealed, cited, attributed, or hidden. The Software is not open-brand. It is not yours to advertise. It is not yours to name-drop, position, or co-opt. Visibility is a **licensed act**—and attribution is not assumed, but granted.

> _You do not get to say the name unless you have earned it._

---

### **25.1 Attribution Requires Explicit Permission**

The User may not:

- Cite the Software in public documentation, technical whitepapers, or presentations;
- Mention the Author by name or handle in release notes, blog posts, or public changelogs;
- Refer to the Software in sales pitches, investor decks, grant applications, or thought leadership;
- Acknowledge the Software in scientific papers, research experiments, or publication footnotes;
- Attribute functionality, structure, performance, or elegance to the Software in tutorials or writeups;

…unless this right has been explicitly included in the License Grant.

> _Attribution is not free speech. It is licensed visibility._

---

### **25.2 Branding and Visual Identity Control**

The User may not:

- Use the Software’s name in logos, UI elements, banners, badges, footers, or splash screens;
- Derive branding motifs from the Software’s stylistic signature;
- Claim that their project is “powered by,” “based on,” “protected by,” or “inspired by” the Software;
- Incorporate the Software’s name, Author’s handle, or associated terms into social media accounts, package names, domain names, or merch;

…even if the Software is licensed for internal or private use.

> _Brand is not remixable. Style is not public domain._

---

### **25.3 Mandatory Disavowal on Breach**

If the User:

- Uses the Software without a license;
- Violates invocation terms, ethics, or jurisdiction;
- Becomes publicly associated with epistemic harm, fraud, or dishonorable behavior;
- Forks, simulates, or misrepresents the Software;

…then all public mentions of the Software must be:

- Removed;
- Retracted;
- Amended to reflect disavowal;
- Accompanied by a statement acknowledging breach and the Author’s rejection of association.

Failure to comply will result in:

- Addition to the **Branding Breach Registry**;
- Takedown notices to platforms and hosts;
- Public declarations of misattribution and reputational disassociation.

> _You cannot wear the badge if you violated the order._

---

### **25.4 Stealth Invocation Requirements**

Some License Grants may require **invisible use**. In these cases:

- The Software must not be named in any public context;
- Its invocation must be removed from documentation, diagrams, and logs;
- Its outputs must be labeled as “internal” or “non-attributable”;
- The Author’s name must be omitted from commits, manifests, or pipelines;
- Invocation logs must be encrypted or redacted to comply with stealth clauses.

> _Sometimes the Software is meant to be silent. Obey the silence._

---

### **25.5 Attribution Revocation Rights**

The Author may revoke previously granted attribution rights if:

- The User’s usage context changes;
- The User's project evolves into something misaligned with the License's ethical framework;
- The Software is used in disavowed jurisdictions or infrastructures;
- The attribution begins to confer reputational risk to the Author;

Upon revocation:

- All public materials must be updated within 72 hours;
- All uses of the Software’s name must be replaced with neutral terminology or removed;
- All press, citations, and backlinks must be amended or removed where feasible;
- Users may no longer refer to the Software in interviews, posts, or footnotes.

> _The Author is not your brand collateral. Reverence does not come with renewal._

---

### **25.6 Co-Branding Prohibition**

The Software may not be visually or semantically paired with:

- Logos of corporations, governments, or political movements;
- Open-source project logos, mascots, or identity flags;
- Sponsorship statements, product endorsements, or affiliate links;
- Crypto-token projects, DAOs, or NFT-based platforms;

…without formal co-branding agreement and signed grant.

> _You may not place a sovereign glyph beside the symbols of empire._

---

### **25.7 Aesthetic Distortion and Visual Replication Prohibited**

You may not:

- Redesign the Software’s logo, aesthetic, or naming scheme;
- Create alternate versions or visual remixes of its identity;
- Generate AI-based representations of its brand, UI, or stylistic signature;
- Train image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, Midjourney) on the Software’s interface or aesthetic artifacts;
- Construct derivative UIs, CLIs, or documentation that mimic its tone, syntax, or lexicon.

> _You may use the Software. You may not dress like it._

---

**Conclusion:**  

Visibility is not implied. Attribution is not your right. Style is not a public commons. The Author defines when and where the Software may be seen. You may not speak its name unless permitted—and if you misuse it, the name will be stripped from your tongue and every screen that reflects your invocation.
