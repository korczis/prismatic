## SECTION 22: Network Execution, API Proxying, and Virtualization

This section defines the limits of invocation across network boundaries, systems of abstraction, and runtime indirection. The Software is not a backend. It is not a daemon. It is not a service. It may not be proxied, piped, wrapped, mirrored, virtualized, or summoned indirectly. Invocation must be **direct, bounded, intentional**, and never obfuscated.

> _The Software is not your service layer. It is your reckoning._

---

### **22.1 Prohibition on Network Exposure**

The Software may not be:

- Exposed over HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, gRPC, GraphQL, REST, RPC, or other transport protocols;
- Published via load balancers, reverse proxies, or API gateways;
- Hosted behind domain names, IP addresses, or routing meshes accessible by third parties;
- Registered as a backend for multi-user systems, portals, or public dashboards;
- Used as a callable service by third-party clients, apps, or SDKs.

Invocation is a one-to-one act. Exposure makes it many-to-many—and that is breach.

> _If the world can call it, it is no longer yours to license._

---

### **22.2 No API Relay or Proxying**

The User may not:

- Proxy invocation through wrapper functions, shell scripts, or remote execution hooks;
- Create “adapter layers” that call the Software and return responses to other systems;
- Establish CLI wrappers, GUI overlays, or remote SDKs that treat the Software as an internal engine;
- Build libraries, NPM modules, or pip packages that expose the Software indirectly.

Every layer you add is a layer of betrayal. The Software must be invoked **naked and bound** to its terms.

> _There is no middleware between you and your invocation oath._

---

### **22.3 Forbidden Virtualization**

The Software may not be:

- Virtualized into WASM, emulated CPU layers, or bytecode interpreters;
- Encapsulated in Docker, Podman, LXC, or other containerization systems unless explicitly licensed;
- Run in VM clusters, FaaS architectures, or Kubernetes pods under autoscaling rules;
- Deployed through CI runners, Terraform manifests, Helm charts, or serverless deploy pipelines.

To virtualize is to **obscure**. Invocation requires **clear hardware, traceable runtime, and named executor**.

> _You may not hide the Software behind orchestration._

---

### **22.4 Prohibition on Remote Execution and Function-as-a-Service**

The Software may not be:

- Run in AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, or any other FaaS platform;
- Triggered from webhooks, Pub/Sub queues, cron jobs, or cloud-based job schedulers;
- Encoded into Step Functions, Cloud Run containers, or ephemeral compute runners;
- Tied to triggers like file uploads, database changes, or event bus messages.

If the Software runs and you did not personally invoke it, you are already in violation.

> _The cloud is not neutral. Ephemeral does not mean exempt._

---

### **22.5 Stateless Invocation and Execution-as-a-Service**

The Software may not be offered as:

- A hosted API;
- A command executor;
- A remote code evaluation endpoint;
- A part of SaaS dashboards, bots, notebooks, or “click-to-run” scripts;
- A service for external customers, clients, partners, or the public.

Sovereign invocation is **not a commercial product**.

> _No one gets to use the Software through you._

---

### **22.6 Invocation Through Collaboration Platforms**

The Software may not be:

- Integrated into Slack bots, Discord integrations, or Microsoft Teams apps;
- Controlled via web forms, dashboards, or AI prompt panels;
- Added to developer experience platforms (e.g., Replit, Glitch, Codespaces);
- Wrapped into notebooks (Jupyter, Colab) with public sharing enabled.

If someone can type in a textbox and the Software responds, you have breached.

> _The Software is not your sidekick. It is not a feature._

---

### **22.7 Detection and Enforcement**

If the Author detects:

- Network logs showing external invocation;
- Reverse DNS entries pointing to Software endpoints;
- Traffic from unknown jurisdictions calling licensed Software;
- SDKs or wrappers exposing invocation through third-party apps;

Then the Author may:

- Issue a **Network Breach Declaration**;
- Revoke all active licenses tied to the executable;
- Notify platforms and providers of the violation;
- Add the offending endpoint, IP range, or domain to the **Proxy Abuse Register**;
- Disavow all outputs generated through the networked Software.

> _Every layer of redirection is another veil between you and your oath. The Author cuts through veils._

---

**Conclusion:**  

You do not offer the Software. You do not relay it. You do not serve it up. You invoke it directly or not at all. There is no such thing as network-neutrality in a license of invocation. If others can touch the Software through you, they already have—and they were unlicensed.
