# Foundations

This section establishes the core definitions, ownership principles, and fundamental concepts that underpin the entire General Honest License framework.

## Contents

### [01. Preamble and Purpose](01-preamble-and-purpose.md)
The fundamental purpose and scope of the license agreement, establishing the protective and restrictive nature of the framework.

### [02. Definitions](02-definitions.md)
Precise definitions of key terms including Author, Software, User, License Grant, Invocation, and other critical concepts that form the epistemic foundation of the license.

### [03. Ownership and Origin](03-ownership-and-origin.md)
Clear establishment of authorship, intellectual property rights, and the autonomous creative context in which the software was developed.

## Key Concepts

- **Sovereign Authorship**: The software represents the exclusive creative output of Tomas Korcak
- **Epistemic Authority**: Definitions are declarations of conceptual authority, not semantic conveniences
- **Protective Framework**: The license is restrictive and protective, not permissive
- **Ceremonial Invocation**: Software usage is treated as a conscious, ritual act
