## SECTION 1: Preamble and Purpose

This License Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement”) constitutes a binding legal instrument governing all forms of access to, interaction with, and utilization of the software, code repositories, tools, applications, utilities, documentation, assets, algorithms, methodologies, interfaces, and associated intellectual constructs collectively referred to as the **Korczis Experimental Software** or **“KX Software”** (hereinafter referred to as the “Software”). The Software, in its entirety and in each of its constituent components, has been conceptualized, designed, developed, implemented, and maintained exclusively by **Tomas Korcak** (hereinafter referred to as the “Author” or “Licensor”), an independent software creator and intellectual property rights holder operating solely under personal initiative and autonomous creative direction.

It is hereby explicitly acknowledged and established that the development of the Software occurred entirely outside of any corporate, institutional, academic, governmental, or third-party context. The Software represents the autonomous creative output of the Author, produced without external direction, without organizational affiliation, without corporate sponsorship, without institutional funding, and without contractual obligation to any third party. The Software embodies the Author’s intellectual sovereignty, creative independence, and uncompromised authorial integrity.

The fundamental purpose of this Agreement is multifaceted and encompasses the following essential objectives:

**First and foremost**, this Agreement serves to **protect, preserve, and defend** the Author’s exclusive intellectual property rights, moral rights, attribution rights, control rights, and economic rights associated with the Software. These rights are **comprehensive**, **indivisible**, and **inalienable**, except through explicit written license grants issued solely at the Author’s discretion.

**Secondly**, this Agreement establishes **clear, unambiguous, and legally binding parameters** regarding authorized and unauthorized behaviors in relation to the Software. It defines the **permissible boundaries of interaction**, delineates **prohibited activities**, and articulates the **consequences of violations**. The Agreement creates a framework of permissions that are granted exclusively through formal License Grants, with all other uses **presumptively prohibited**.

**Thirdly**, this Agreement ensures **structural alignment** between usage patterns and the **authorial framework** within which the Software was created. It guarantees that all deployments, implementations, integrations, and applications of the Software remain **consistent with the Author’s technical vision**, **conceptual integrity**, and **ethical boundaries**. The Agreement protects against **unauthorized modification**, **undesired extension**, **inappropriate application**, or **unintended contextualization**.

**Fourthly**, this Agreement establishes **definitive jurisdictional parameters and enforcement procedures** applicable in the event of disputes, challenges, violations, or unauthorized use. It creates legal certainty regarding **governing law**, **venue selection**, and **available remedies**, thereby enabling efficient resolution of potential conflicts.

This Agreement is **not a form contract**. It is **not an open-source license**. It is **not a permissive grant of rights**. Rather, it is a **restrictive**, **protective**, and **carefully calibrated legal instrument** designed to preserve the **Author’s intellectual sovereignty** while allowing for **controlled**, **authorized**, and **appropriately bounded use** of the Software under specific conditions defined exclusively by the Author.

By accessing, viewing, downloading, installing, executing, copying, analyzing, testing, evaluating, or otherwise interacting with the Software in any manner whatsoever, parties acknowledge their understanding of and **agreement to be bound** by all terms, conditions, restrictions, and obligations set forth in this Agreement. In the absence of a formal License Grant explicitly issued by the Author, **no rights of use are conveyed**, and **any interaction with the Software is presumptively unauthorized**.

The Author reserves the exclusive right to **amend**, **modify**, **update**, or **revise** this Agreement at any time and for any reason, with such changes becoming effective immediately upon communication to authorized users or upon posting of the revised Agreement alongside the Software or in any repository containing the Software.
