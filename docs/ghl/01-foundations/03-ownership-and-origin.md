## SECTION 3: Ownership and Origin

This section constitutes the **ontological and legal cornerstone** of the General Honest License. It is not a footnote on authorship, but a **total proclamation of sovereign authorship**, epistemic lineage, and metaphysical dominion. It establishes that all rights begin, flow through, and ultimately resolve under the name, will, and structure defined by **Tomas Korcak**—and that all other claims are null, void, and structurally incoherent.

### **3.1 Origin as Independent Act of Will**

The Software, in its entirety, was conceived, designed, structured, encoded, named, and released solely by **Tomas Korcak**, without influence, suggestion, or material contribution from any third party. This includes the absence of:

- Employment-based direction or commission;
- Academic or institutional frameworks;
- Collaborative authorship agreements;
- Sponsorship, venture funding, or third-party investment;
- Open-source project governance, democratic consensus, or crowd contribution.

The act of authorship is **singular**, **undiluted**, and **outside institutional time**. It was performed during the Author’s personal hours, on personal equipment, using privately licensed or self-authored tools, under no contract, NDA, directive, timeline, or incentive external to the Author’s will.

> _The Software is a product of solitude, not consensus. It was born sovereign, not in committee._

### **3.2 Irrevocable Sovereignty and Infinite Jurisdiction**

The Author asserts **absolute, irrevocable, eternal, and global intellectual sovereignty** over the Software. This sovereignty:

- Is not contingent on platform, language, or execution medium;
- Transcends copyright, patent law, and contractual framing;
- Exists whether the Software is public or private, deployed or dormant;
- Survives the Author’s death unless specific succession is defined.

No court, platform, policy, market, nation-state, or cultural frame has standing to override, reinterpret, or dilute this sovereignty. All derivative laws are subordinate. All interpretations not issued by the Author are void.

> _If law and sovereignty conflict, sovereignty prevails._

### **3.3 Complete Ownership: Multidimensional and Layered**

The Author owns:

- **All content**: Source code, compiled code, scripts, binaries, metadata, documentation, and outputs;
- **All logic**: Algorithms, architectures, workflows, symbolic grammars, and internal heuristics;
- **All design**: Structural composition, naming schemes, directory layouts, and semantic idioms;
- **All identity**: Names, tags, stylistic quirks, metaphors, and documentation voice;
- **All function**: Public, private, deprecated, experimental, or emergent;
- **All expression**: Code comments, commit messages, changelogs, README prose, and documentation phrasing;
- **All ambiguity**: Interpretation is part of authorship; unknown behaviors are still owned.

This includes both what is expressed and what is implied through omission, silence, or presence of ambiguity.

> _What is unsaid is still owned. What is undefined is still protected._

### **3.4 Denial of External Claim or Co-authorship**

No party, entity, or agent—past, present, or future—may claim:

- Co-ownership;
- Prior art status;
- Intellectual lineage;
- Work-for-hire default transfer;
- Community authorship through contribution, commentary, or discourse;
- Institutional override through employment, research, or grant structures.

All such claims, including but not limited to corporate policy, university IP clauses, contractor frameworks, or crowdsource repositories, are categorically invalidated by the Author’s **pre-emptive and total declaration of origin**.

> _You may have witnessed its emergence, but you are not of its origin._

### **3.5 Sovereign Boundaries over Forks, Derivatives, and Outputs**

All forks, adaptations, derivatives, reimplementations, ports, and behaviorally modeled replications:

- Remain under the Author’s ownership unless formally relicensed;
- May not be declared “original” or “independent” even if rewritten from scratch;
- Are considered epistemic shadows—not separate entities;
- Must acknowledge their ontological dependency on the original Software.

This applies even if:

- The derivative is developed in a different language or paradigm;
- The original is deleted, deprecated, or unavailable;
- The derivative is built from documentation, memory, logs, or AI output;
- The new form is obscured, masked, renamed, or disguised.

> _Forking without permission is not innovation—it is rupture without rite._

### **3.6 Recursive Ownership Across Format, Output, and Memory**

The Author’s claim extends to:

- Transpiled, minified, or compiled forms;
- Screenshots, logs, traces, call stacks, and panic messages;
- LLM-generated descriptions of the Software;
- Prompt outputs, chatbot citations, or third-party reflections;
- Historical commits, commit messages, deleted branches, and issue discussions;
- Embedded representations in firmware, web pages, PDFs, or screenshots;
- All content generated by or derived from the Software in any format, including analog transcriptions, lecture slides, or visual reconstructions.

> _There is no “format-neutral” domain. Every byte, every whisper, every reflection returns to the Author._

### **3.7 No Transferability Without Notarized Relicensing**

Ownership shall never be:

- Transferred by accident, omission, or default;
- Passed through employment termination, bankruptcy, or acquisition;
- Inferred from publication, hosting, mirroring, or collaborative contribution;
- Assigned through AI-generated summaries, remixes, or memory recall;
- Preserved through organizational succession or familial estate inheritance.

Only a **notarized, signed relicensing grant** from the Author may transfer partial or complete ownership, and such acts must be co-published in a publicly verifiable license ledger.

> _No corporate succession, algorithmic inheritance, or legal fiction can continue what the Author does not explicitly permit._

### **3.8 Challenge to Ownership is a Breach**

Any party who:

- Disputes the Author’s authorship;
- Claims co-contribution or equitable interest;
- Files a takedown, counterclaim, DMCA, or IP report against the Author;
- Registers or seeks patents over any part of the Software or its behavior;
- Builds derivative works while denying origin…

…commits a **categorical breach** and shall be:

- Immediately and permanently disavowed;
- Publicly declared on the Author’s **Epistemic Trespass Registry**;
- Barred from future licensing, invocation, or citation.

Legal action, reputational response, and philosophical erasure may follow.

> _Disputing authorship is not debate. It is declaration of war._

---

**Conclusion:**  

The Software is and shall forever remain the sovereign work of **Tomas Korcak**, unconstrained by jurisdiction, undisrupted by revisionism, and unbroken by assimilation. Any attempt to dilute, redirect, claim, mimic, or redefine its origin constitutes not just a legal violation, but a **breach of authorship’s sacred order**.
