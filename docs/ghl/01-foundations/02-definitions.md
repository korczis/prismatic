## SECTION 2: Definitions

For the purposes of this License Agreement (the “Agreement”), the following definitions shall apply. These definitions are not merely semantic conveniences—they are declarations of conceptual authority and epistemic finality. They are to be interpreted with maximal precision and shall prevail in any interpretive dispute, across all jurisdictions, contexts, and systems of thought.

### **2.1 “Author” or “Licensor”**

Refers exclusively to **Tomas Korcak**, the sole natural person who originated, developed, and retains absolute dominion over the Software. The Author’s status is not that of a vendor, employee, agent, or contributor. The Author is a sovereign, autonomous actor whose creative will is the sole source of legitimacy behind the Software’s existence. The Author's rights are unmediated, unabridged, and not subject to review, negotiation, or revocation by any entity—public, private, governmental, or computational. No third party may inherit, infer, or assume this role without express, notarized declaration by the Author.

### **2.2 “Software”**

Denotes the totality of the **Korczis Experimental Software**, also referred to as **“KX Software.”** This includes, but is not limited to:

- Source code (in all languages, dialects, or formats);
- Compiled binaries, object files, bytecode, or interpreted scripts;
- Documentation, README files, examples, notebooks, test suites, and manuals;
- User interfaces, command-line interfaces, APIs, protocols, and schemas;
- Algorithmic structures, symbolic constructs, data flows, and model embeddings;
- Metadata, configuration files, templates, pipelines, and logic flows;
- Outputs generated by the Software, whether deterministic or stochastic;
- All previous, current, future, or imagined versions, branches, forks, or derivatives—regardless of completion state or publication.

The Software is not merely a collection of files; it is a **sovereign, cohesive epistemic artifact**, and must be regarded as such.

### **2.3 “User”**

Any person, legal entity, autonomous agent, automated system, or collective operation that:

- Accesses;
- Executes;
- Integrates with;
- Copies;
- Analyzes;
- Observes;
- Mirrors;
- Translates;
- Interacts with, or causes interaction with

any portion of the Software, directly or indirectly.

A User may be human or non-human, aware or unaware, authorized or unauthorized. All interaction creates obligations under this Agreement, regardless of legal capacity, technological mediation, or jurisdictional edge cases.

> _You are a User the moment you cross the epistemic threshold of invocation—intention, ignorance, or accident is irrelevant._

### **2.4 “License Grant”**

A formal, explicit, unambiguous, written agreement issued directly and solely by the Author. A License Grant must:

- Be time-bound, purpose-bound, and contextually specific;
- Be signed (digitally or physically) by the Author;
- Specify technical and ethical boundaries of use;
- Enumerate restrictions, expirations, and revocation clauses;
- Include the legal identity of the recipient;
- Be verifiable by the Author’s license issuance ledger or cryptographic receipt.

License Grants are not transferable, inheritably binding, perpetual, or implicit. The absence of a License Grant means that **no rights exist**. This clause is final.

### **2.5 “Scope of Use”**

The exact, written boundaries defined within a valid License Grant describing:

- The systems in which the Software may operate;
- The users, agents, or departments that may invoke it;
- The environments (e.g., dev, prod, test) in which it may reside;
- The rate, volume, and concurrency of its execution;
- The integration depth, exposure level, and containment obligations.

> _Any action outside this Scope—regardless of intent or benefit—is Unauthorized Use._

### **2.6 “Unauthorized Use”**

Any use of the Software that:

- Occurs without a License Grant;
- Exceeds the Scope of Use defined therein;
- Bypasses, circumvents, or disregards enforcement conditions;
- Integrates, wraps, proxies, or distributes the Software without permission;
- Engages in observation, modeling, inference, or derivative synthesis;
- Occurs after termination, revocation, expiration, or Author disavowal.

Unauthorized Use is not a lesser form of use—it is a **violation**. It is a breach. It is treated as software trespass, contract infringement, and intellectual expropriation.

### **2.7 “Invocation”**

The act of execution, interaction, or any form of epistemic engagement with the Software. Invocation is **ceremonial**, not mechanical. It includes:

- Executing binaries;
- Running scripts;
- Calling APIs;
- Analyzing outputs;
- Loading into memory;
- Triggering events or workflows that cause the Software to act.

> _Invocation is treated as a sacred act. Without understanding, ritual, or consent, it is null and void._

### **2.8 “Derivative Genesis”**

Any transformation, adaptation, port, reimplementation, or imitation—conceptual or technical—that:

- Would not have occurred without exposure to the Software;
- Depends on internal or observed behavior of the Software;
- Uses the Software as a model, scaffold, influence, or test oracle;
- Is built from logs, traces, summaries, or output-based feedback;
- Is trained on or with Software-related content (in whole or part).

Derivative Genesis is strictly forbidden without explicit written permission. It is not creativity. It is unlicensed reproduction.

### **2.9 “Sovereign Rights”**

The inalienable bundle of intellectual, philosophical, legal, aesthetic, moral, computational, and interpretive powers held solely by the Author. These rights:

- Cannot be waived, nullified, or transferred without explicit, notarized act;
- Override all jurisdictional edge cases, platform policies, and user norms;
- Are global in scope, infinite in time, and recursive in authority.

Sovereign Rights supersede platform terms, repo metadata, and legal interpretation—**they are self-defining.**

### **2.10 “Epistemic Drift”**

The degradation of the Software’s conceptual integrity caused by:

- Misinterpretation;
- Oversimplification;
- Reduction to analogy;
- Framing in popular, pedagogical, or corporate terms;
- Use in academic or cultural narratives without fidelity to the License.

Epistemic Drift is not a neutral accident—it is a **semantic breach**. The Software must be referenced, understood, and invoked only in alignment with the Author’s declared frame.

> **All undefined terms shall be interpreted in a manner that maximally protects the Author’s interests, restricts User improvisation, and defends the metaphysical architecture of the License.**
