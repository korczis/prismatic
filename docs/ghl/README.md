## Overview

The General Honest License (GHL) is a comprehensive legal framework governing the use of Korczis Experimental Software (KX Software). This license establishes sovereign intellectual property rights and defines strict boundaries for software interaction, invocation, and usage.

## Document Structure

This license is organized into six main categories:

### [01. Foundations](01-foundations/)
Core definitions, ownership principles, and fundamental concepts that underpin the entire license framework.

### [02. Legal Framework](02-legal-framework/)
Traditional legal provisions including license grants, restrictions, termination, liability, and jurisdictional matters.

### [03. Technical Restrictions](03-technical-restrictions/)
Detailed technical boundaries covering cryptographic restrictions, computational constraints, integration limits, and derivative work prohibitions.

### [04. Enforcement](04-enforcement/)
Mechanisms for interpretation, enforcement, and maintaining license integrity over time.

### [05. Philosophy](05-philosophy/)
The philosophical and epistemic foundations that inform the license's approach to software sovereignty.

### [06. Appendices](06-appendices/)
Supporting materials including the Oath of Licensed Invocation and visual previews.

## Key Principles

- **Sovereignty**: The software represents the author's intellectual sovereignty and creative independence
- **Ceremonial Invocation**: Software usage is treated as a conscious, ritual act requiring proper alignment
- **Epistemic Integrity**: Protection against dilution, misinterpretation, and unauthorized derivation
- **Bounded Usage**: All permissions are explicitly granted; everything else is prohibited
- **Human Accountability**: No autonomous or machine invocation without human oversight

## License Status

This license is **final** and **sovereign**. It supersedes platform terms, repository metadata, and conventional legal interpretation. All terms are self-defining and must be interpreted to maximally protect the author's interests.
