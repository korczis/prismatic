# Prismatic Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the **Prismatic AI Agent Framework** - a sophisticated platform for building intelligent, fault-tolerant multi-agent systems with real-world applications in crisis intervention, algorithmic trading, content moderation, and advanced AI research.

## 🎯 What is Prismatic?

Prismatic is an advanced AI agent framework built on Elixir/OTP that provides:

- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Sophisticated agent coordination and society management
- **Crisis Intervention**: Mental health crisis detection and intervention systems
- **Consciousness Research**: Nabla-Infinity recursive introspection framework
- **Real-World Applications**: Production-ready solutions across multiple industries
- **Bulletproof Architecture**: Fault-tolerant, distributed, and scalable design

## 📚 Documentation Sections
