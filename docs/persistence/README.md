# Persistence System Documentation

The persistence system provides state serialization, recovery mechanisms, data durability, and backup strategies for the Prismatic framework.

## 📋 Overview

The persistence system enables:
- **State Serialization**: Complete agent and system state persistence with versioning
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic state restoration after failures or restarts
- **Migration System**: Seamless upgrades between system versions
- **Backup Strategies**: Comprehensive data protection and disaster recovery
- **Configuration Persistence**: Dynamic configuration with rollback capabilities
- **Audit Trails**: Complete history of system changes and operations

## 🏗️ Architecture

The persistence system integrates with PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and other storage backends to provide reliable data durability and recovery capabilities.
