# Cognitive Biases Detection and Mitigation

The Cognitive Biases Detection and Mitigation system identifies cognitive biases in human reasoning and decision-making, providing countermeasures and educational interventions to improve judgment quality.

## üìã Overview

The system provides:
- **Bias Detection**: Automated identification of cognitive biases in text and behavior
- **Bias Classification**: Comprehensive taxonomy of cognitive bias types
- **Decision Analysis**: Evaluation of decision-making processes and outcomes
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Evidence-based interventions to reduce bias impact
- **Educational Components**: Training and awareness programs
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracking bias reduction and decision improvement

## üß† Cognitive Bias Categories

### Confirmation Biases
- **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking information that confirms existing beliefs
- **Cherry Picking**: Selectively choosing supportive evidence
- **Motivated Reasoning**: Reasoning toward desired conclusions
- **Belief Perseverance**: Maintaining beliefs despite contradictory evidence
- **Backfire Effect**: Strengthening beliefs when confronted with opposing evidence

### Availability Biases
- **Availability Heuristic**: Overweighting easily recalled information
- **Recency Bias**: Giving more weight to recent events
- **Salience Bias**: Focusing on prominent or memorable features
- **Vividness Bias**: Overweighting emotionally striking information
- **Frequency Illusion**: Noticing things more after becoming aware of them

### Anchoring and Adjustment
- **Anchoring Bias**: Over-relying on first information received
- **Adjustment Bias**: Insufficient adjustment from initial anchor
- **Priming Effects**: Influence of prior exposure on judgment
- **Status Quo Bias**: Preference for current state of affairs
- **Endowment Effect**: Overvaluing owned items

### Social and Authority Biases
- **Authority Bias**: Attributing greater accuracy to authority figures
- **Bandwagon Effect**: Adopting beliefs because others hold them
- **Social Proof**: Following others' behavior in uncertain situations
- **Conformity Bias**: Matching attitudes and beliefs to group norms
- **Halo Effect**: Generalizing from one positive trait to overall judgment

## üîç Detection Mechanisms

### Behavioral Analysis
- **Decision Pattern Recognition**: Identifying systematic deviations from rationality
- **Choice Architecture Analysis**: Understanding how context influences decisions
- **Temporal Decision Tracking**: Monitoring decision changes over time
- **Consistency Evaluation**: Detecting inconsistent preferences and judgments

### Language Analysis
- **Linguistic Markers**: Words and phrases associated with biased thinking
- **Certainty Indicators**: Expressions of overconfidence or underconfidence
- **Emotional Language**: Detecting emotionally charged reasoning
- **Hedging Patterns**: Identifying uncertainty and qualification patterns

### Physiological Monitoring
- **Eye Tracking**: Attention patterns and information processing
- **Neuroimaging**: Brain activity patterns associated with biased thinking
- **Physiological Responses**: Stress and arousal indicators during decision-making
- **Reaction Time Analysis**: Speed of responses indicating automatic vs. deliberate processing

## üéØ Mitigation Strategies

### Debiasing Techniques
- **Consider the Opposite**: Actively seeking contradictory evidence
- **Devil's Advocate**: Systematic challenging of assumptions
- **Pre-mortem Analysis**: Imagining failure scenarios before decisions
- **Reference Class Forecasting**: Using similar past cases for prediction
- **Structured Decision Processes**: Formal frameworks for complex decisions

### Environmental Interventions
- **Choice Architecture**: Designing decision environments to reduce bias
- **Default Options**: Setting beneficial defaults to guide behavior
- **Feedback Systems**: Providing outcome information to improve calibration
- **Cooling-off Periods**: Introducing delays for emotional decisions
- **Accountability Measures**: Creating responsibility for decision quality

### Educational Approaches

### Decision Quality Metrics
- **Accuracy Measures**: Correctness of predictions and judgments
- **Calibration Scores**: Alignment between confidence and accuracy
- **Discrimination Ability**: Distinguishing between different options
- **Consistency Indices**: Stability of preferences across contexts
- **Bias Reduction Scores**: Improvement in decision-making over time

## üî¨ Advanced Applications
