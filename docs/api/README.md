# API Documentation

The API system provides REST and GraphQL interfaces for external integration, programmatic access, and third-party application development.

## üìã Overview

The API system enables:
- **REST API**: RESTful endpoints for standard CRUD operations and system interaction
- **GraphQL API**: Flexible query interface for complex data retrieval and manipulation
- **Authentication**: Secure access control with API keys, OAuth, and JWT tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse with configurable rate limits
- **Documentation**: Interactive API documentation with examples and testing
- **Webhooks**: Event-driven notifications for external system integration

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The API system is built on Phoenix framework with comprehensive authentication, authorization, and monitoring capabilities.
