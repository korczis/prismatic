# Monitoring Documentation

The monitoring system provides comprehensive health checks, alerting, and operational oversight for all components of the Prismatic framework.

## üìã Overview

The monitoring system includes:
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time system health checks and status tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Resource utilization, response times, and throughput monitoring
- **Alert Management**: Configurable alerts for system anomalies and threshold breaches
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with search and analysis capabilities
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flow tracking across microservices
- **Incident Management**: Automated incident detection and response workflows

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The monitoring system is built on industry-standard observability tools with custom integrations for AI agent-specific metrics.

### Key Components

- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus-compatible metric gathering
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with structured data
- **Alerting Engine**: Rule-based alert generation and notification
- **Dashboards**: Real-time visualization of system health
- **Tracing System**: Distributed request tracking and analysis
- **Incident Response**: Automated escalation and notification workflows

### Monitoring Layers

1. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Server resources, network, and storage
2. **Application Monitoring**: Service health, performance, and errors
3. **Agent Monitoring**: AI agent behavior, decision patterns, and anomalies
4. **Society Monitoring**: Group dynamics, interaction health, and emergence patterns
