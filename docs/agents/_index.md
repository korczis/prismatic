# Agent System Documentation

Agents are the fundamental building blocks of the Prismatic framework. Each agent is an autonomous entity capable of perception, reasoning, decision-making, and action. This section covers the design, implementation, and behavioral patterns of individual agents.

## üéØ Agent Fundamentals

### Core Concepts
- **Autonomy**: Agents operate independently and make their own decisions
- **Reactivity**: Respond to environmental changes and events
- **Proactivity**: Take initiative to achieve goals
- **Social Ability**: Communicate and coordinate with other agents

### Agent Architecture
- **Perception Layer**: Environmental sensing and input processing
- **Reasoning Engine**: Decision-making and planning capabilities
- **Memory System**: Multi-layer memory for learning and adaptation
- **Action Interface**: Execution of decisions in the environment

### Protocol-Based Design
- **Behavior Protocols**: Define agent capabilities through Elixir protocols
- **Message Protocols**: Standardized inter-agent communication
- **State Protocols**: Consistent state management across agents
- **Learning Protocols**: Adaptive behavior and knowledge acquisition

## üß† Agent Components

### Memory Systems
- **Working Memory**: Short-term operational data
- **Episodic Memory**: Experience and event history
- **Semantic Memory**: Knowledge and learned concepts
- **Procedural Memory**: Skills and behavioral patterns

### Reasoning Capabilities
- **Logical Reasoning**: Rule-based decision making
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Uncertainty handling
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Time-aware planning
- **Causal Reasoning**: Understanding cause-effect relationships

### Learning Mechanisms
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Goal-oriented behavior optimization
- **Supervised Learning**: Pattern recognition from examples
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovery of hidden patterns
- **Transfer Learning**: Knowledge application across domains

## üîÑ Agent Lifecycle

### Initialization
1. **Agent Spawning**: Create new agent process
2. **Protocol Registration**: Register behavioral capabilities
3. **Memory Initialization**: Set up memory systems
4. **Environment Connection**: Establish environmental interfaces

### Operation
1. **Perception Cycle**: Continuous environmental monitoring
2. **Reasoning Cycle**: Decision-making and planning
3. **Action Cycle**: Execution of planned actions
4. **Learning Cycle**: Experience integration and adaptation

### Termination
1. **Graceful Shutdown**: Complete ongoing tasks
2. **State Persistence**: Save important state information
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Release system resources
4. **Notification**: Inform other agents of termination

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Patterns

### Agent Supervision
```elixir
defmodule Prismatic.Agent.Supervisor do
  use Supervisor
  
  def start_link(opts) do
    Supervisor.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, name: __MODULE__)
  end
  
  def init(_opts) do
    children = [
      {Prismatic.Agent.Registry, []},
      {DynamicSupervisor, name: Prismatic.Agent.DynamicSupervisor, strategy: :one_for_one}
    ]
    
    Supervisor.init(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
```

### Agent Behavior Protocol
```elixir
defprotocol Prismatic.Agent.Behavior do
  @doc "Process incoming message"
  def handle_message(agent, message)
  
  @doc "Execute reasoning cycle"
  def reason(agent, context)
  
  @doc "Perform action in environment"
  def act(agent, action)
  
  @doc "Update agent state"
  def update_state(agent, new_state)
end
```

### Agent State Management
```elixir
defmodule Prismatic.Agent.State do
  defstruct [
    :id,
    :type,
    :goals,
    :beliefs,
    :intentions,
    :memory,
    :capabilities,
    :status
  ]
  
  def new(id, type, opts \\ []) do
    %__MODULE__{
      id: id,
      type: type,
      goals: Keyword.get(opts, :goals, []),
      beliefs: Keyword.get(opts, :beliefs, %{}),
      intentions: Keyword.get(opts, :intentions, []),
      memory: Prismatic.Memory.new(),
      capabilities: Keyword.get(opts, :capabilities, []),
      status: :active
    }
  end
end
```

## üé≠ Agent Types

### Reactive Agents
- **Event-Driven**: Respond to environmental stimuli
- **Rule-Based**: Follow predefined behavioral rules
- **Fast Response**: Minimal reasoning overhead
- **Use Cases**: Monitoring, alerting, simple automation

### Deliberative Agents
- **Goal-Oriented**: Work towards specific objectives
- **Planning**: Create and execute multi-step plans
- **Reasoning**: Complex decision-making capabilities
- **Use Cases**: Problem-solving, optimization, strategy

### Hybrid Agents
- **Layered Architecture**: Combine reactive and deliberative layers
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Switch between modes based on context
- **Balanced Performance**: Fast reactions with strategic planning
- **Use Cases**: Real-world applications, complex environments

### Learning Agents
- **Adaptive**: Improve performance through experience
- **Knowledge Acquisition**: Build understanding over time
- **Generalization**: Apply learning to new situations
- **Use Cases**: Personalization, optimization, discovery

## üîó Integration Points

### Society Integration
- **Agent Registration**: Join agent societies
- **Role Assignment**: Take on specific roles within groups
- **Coordination**: Participate in group decision-making
- **Communication**: Exchange information with peers

### Memory Integration
- **Shared Memory**: Access collective knowledge
- **Memory Synchronization**: Keep distributed state consistent
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Contribute to collective intelligence
- **Privacy**: Maintain agent-specific private information

### Environment Integration
- **Sensor Integration**: Connect to environmental data sources
- **Actuator Control**: Influence the environment through actions
- **Feedback Loops**: Learn from environmental responses
- **Adaptation**: Adjust behavior based on environmental changes
