# Memory System Documentation

The memory system provides multi-layered memory architecture for agents, supporting working memory, episodic memory, semantic memory, and procedural memory patterns.

## üìã Overview

The memory system enables:
- **Working Memory**: Short-term operational data and active context
- **Episodic Memory**: Experience and event history with temporal organization
- **Semantic Memory**: Knowledge and learned concepts with associative networks
- **Procedural Memory**: Skills and behavioral patterns with execution contexts
- **Memory Consolidation**: Automatic organization and optimization of stored information
- **Cross-Modal Integration**: Unified memory access across different agent systems

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The memory system is built on a multi-layered architecture that supports different types of memory storage and retrieval patterns, integrated with the broader Prismatic agent framework.

## üéØ Implementation Status

- [ ] **Phase 2**: Basic Memory System
  - [ ] Working memory implementation
  - [ ] Basic persistence layer
  - [ ] Memory protocol definitions

- [ ] **Phase 6**: Advanced Memory Features
  - [ ] Multi-layered memory architecture
  - [ ] Memory consolidation algorithms
  - [ ] Cross-modal memory integration
