# Analytics Documentation

The analytics system provides comprehensive data collection, analysis, and visualization capabilities for monitoring system performance, agent behavior, and society dynamics.

## üìã Overview

The analytics system enables:
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time system metrics and performance tracking
- **Agent Analytics**: Individual agent behavior analysis and optimization insights
- **Society Metrics**: Group dynamics, interaction patterns, and emergence tracking
- **Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning-based forecasting and trend analysis
- **Custom Dashboards**: Configurable visualization and reporting interfaces
- **Data Export**: Integration with external analytics and business intelligence tools

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The analytics system is built on a streaming data pipeline with real-time processing and historical analysis capabilities.

### Key Components
